ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNYOXUzYnF3RRAB,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNuNE8yQ1dREAE,Yellow Thai Curry Bowl with Chicken was delicious
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ3eU5tY1RREAE,Clean slate catered our wedding and it was phenomenal! All of our guests loved the taco bar. These guys are awesome to plan an event with! 10/10 recommend for any catering needs.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNyeDY2RV9RRRAB,"This place has me feeling like a health goddess over my lunch hour. Lovely ingredients, delicious (and large portioned) meals, and incredibly friendly staff. Plant-based and omnivorous meals are both available here. I love this sustainable, whole foods-focused place!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNMb2ItWXd3RRAB,I have allergies and I like to eat healthy. This place is fantastic. I was in Omaha for training and had lunch and dinner 4 days in a row here. Solid 5 stars.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNMLXZiVHJRRRAB,"I can't recommend Clean Slate enough to all my friends and family! They are one of the only businesses I know in the area who provides fresh and healthy meals, and one of even fewer businesses who offer vegan options!!! My husband and I love the variety of meals that come in each week's meal sets, there's always so much variety! The staff at Clean Slate is always so friendly and accommodating, they make ordering and delivery of meals a breeze. We love their downtown space as well, it's always nice to stop in and pick up a few extra meals for the week or enjoy a warm meal down at their shop. If you haven't had Clean Slate before, give it a try, you won't regret it!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNMNnFTSERnEAE,"I had the privilege of meeting the people who work at this eatery while working as security at the college world series on Friday and Saturday.  they are amazing every single person who works there the food is outstanding I could not believe how amazing everything taste.  I will never forget their customer service their food and I will be coming to eat there frequently in the future! I love everything I love the atmosphere the food the people their employees it's a great area and in this area of town there is this wonderful wonderful clean slate restaurant that will never forget.
On a personal note I know you probably won't remember me but I will remember and love you for all time thank you so much for all the love you showed everyone!!
POSITIVE VIBES ONLY

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNMeXNXV253RRAB,"Was so lucky to find such a clean good restaurant in Omaha. They have prepped food to go as well as a sitting area to order fresh food. We had the panang curry, chicken sandwich, brassica salad and the tropical smoothie. All excellent. It’s not too far from the stadium either."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR6NVpLV0dBEAE,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqOFl1LWpBRRAB,"Excellent food, great people. Love giving my money to locals with a good product."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqOGZPS3ZBRRAB,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEdmVxUzRnRRAB,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEc3BxQVlnEAE,Clean slate has been a life safer for me - they cater to my gluten and dairy allergy and the food quality and flavor is top notch.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEZ3RQSWtBRRAB,I love the healthy options and all of the different variety of meals each week. It’s great knowing my lunch is taken care of everyday. Everything is so yummy and I’ve never had any packaging or delivery issues.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEOU1DTG1nRRAB,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN0dUk3dldnEAE,"This is an amazing service and great food. I work from home so having a healthy, great-tasting variety of meals each week that I didn’t have to plan and prep is great. Service and communication is excellent as well. Highly recommend."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEMUtyMmxBRRAB,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEbEpxZmJnEAE,"Clean Slate meal delivery service is awesome. Each week you get 6 items delivered to your door. The food is fresh, delicious, and served in almost all compostable containers (that you return to be composted). In 3 months, I haven't had a repeat dish - good because I get to try new things, only bad because there have been some awesome meals I would like to have again. The salads and sauces are amazing. Some of my favorite dishes have been a harissa chicken bowl, baingan bharta, a sweet potato/kale/turkey buddha bowl, and a creamy mushroom soup.  I highly recommend this meal service!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNENUlHWEtBEAE,I have used Clean Slate delivery service for over 2 years now and I love it. They now have the option to choose your meals and it’s one less thing I have to worry about during the week. It makes clean eating way more convenient!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNENU9LQUxnEAE,"We’ve been trying to eat healthier and get out of our comfortable food “rut”.  We’ve looked at other meal delivery options , but found nothing with the variety, appealing entrees and convenience of Clean Slate.  We have been so satisfied with the quality, taste and portion size of products, the convenience of ordering (and requesting substitutions), and the efficiency of delivery.  It’s also a great way to become a bit more “food adventurous “!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEcEtfQ0pnEAE,"Loyal subscriber! Clean Slate is a VERY welcomed part of my weekly routine. Having healthy meals on hand throughout the week has eliminated the need for expensive, last minute food deliveries and over eating random snacks as a meal. I've tried many food subscriptions from Blue Apron to Factor to Daily Harvest - and this is it for me! The food is fresh, clean and often local. And on top of it affordable when you consider what you save on groceries and ordering. I often work late and having a fun meal waiting for dinner has been a game changer. The delivery team is friendly and accessible if there are any issues."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEcEwyVk13EAE,"Great people, Great food/meals, awesome all around! Would recommend 100%"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURkMVpxcThBRRAB,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR0NFlUWlVREAE,We stopped in for lunch.  We ordered a few meals off the regular menu as well as the special of the day.  Everything was so delicious.  The shaved pork loin sandwich and breakfast hash were A++.  All our food came out quick and hot. I get their weekly meals delivered to my house and this was nice to try their hot fresh meals in their cafe.  I especially like how I can grab more grab and go meals for the week at the cafe.  You have to try this place.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN0NDlHUEdnEAE,"I am not a huge health nut, and definitely love my animal protein, but I usually walk across the street once a week to grab lunch here, and their lunch specials are SO GOOD (and most are not vegan/plant-based in case you also are a carnivore). I have had such diverse but so delicious food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN0MllyQ01REAE,"I LOVE Clean Slate! Healthy, tasty meals that are delivered right to my door. It makes it so much easier for me to eat healthy when I’m too busy to meal plan. I love the option to choose my own custom meals so I can have a variety of plant based and meat based meals. It also allows me the opportunity to choose how many meals I need for the week."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN0Mk4tMVVREAE,I can’t rave about the plant based meals from Clean Slate enough! Always so scrumptious I couldn’t possibly pick a favorite!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN0bU8zVEZ3EAE,"I’ve been a customer of Clean Slate for two years and love it! I subscribe to the plant-based options and my husband even joined in because the food is healthy, unprocessed, and delicious. It’s a time saving way to be healthy and every person from the owners to the drivers are friendly, helpful, and responsive. Highly recommend!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMxbXU3djdBRRAB,You guys are sleeping on this place! Amazing food and real food  love this place.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNsMjZDaDd3RRAB,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURwNzl2REN3EAE,I can’t say enough good things about the fried Uncrustables. So weirdly satisfying!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURwczQzaXdRRRAB,"This place is the best! Their meals are always so unique and delicious. You're not just getting a burger and fries every other week. It's a great way to experience cuisines from different cultures and keep things interesting.

My husband and I subscribe and we feel like the price is great for what we get. The delivery process is slick and the low waste is one of my favorite parts!

The fact that they accommodate allergies just really puts them over the top. All my communications with them have received prompt responses!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURwM0pEbXFnRRAB,Loved all the vegan options! Love that you can dine in for lunch or take away
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNKaUpTRWdBRRAB,"Clean slate is amazing! Their food is always hot, fresh, and flavorful. I also really enjoy their Kombucha. The staff is kind and attentive."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR4bjg2aTNBRRAB,Clean Slate is the best! Everyone there is very friendly and clearly care about what they make. The cafe is well designed and the food is incredible.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR4aGJhZnFRRRAB,"I love Clean Slate! Their employees are so kind and fun! Everything on the menu just always looks so good, so you really can't wrong. The meals are generously portioned and super filling! I really appreciate their commitment to sustainability as well, as containers are compostable."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR4LU5LZ1FnEAE,"Breakfast Hash
w/turmeric tofu scramble

Beautiful start of the day ❤️"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR4LUpLTDZRRRAB,"Breakfast Hash with egg and bacon. Simple, fresh, delicious. First time here, but highly recommend!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4aDllMTV3RRAB,"We ordered our food delivered to us at Kros Strain Millworks and the food arrived fast, friendly, and delicious!!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4bGViNDNRRRAB,"I have meetings every Monday, and I love stopping by to get breakfast here. Just amazing food!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOGNiX09REAE,Have been on the meal plan for a couple months and absolutely love it!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSZ3BHdnVBRRAB,"Been ordering Clean Slate meals for years, always wanted them to start a restaurant.

This was worth the wait. Their takeout meals are now able to be ordered ala carte AND they have an amazing made to order menu. We ordered the curry, soup, and pork sandwich.

This was the best lunch I have had in Omaha, big portions but I didn’t feel sick/uncomfortable after because the food is so healthy.

15/10 would recommend"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNFpqU3FnRRAB,"Clean Slate Food Co. has a huge variety of on-menu and meal-to-go food-options. I highly recommend the oyster shell mushroom and chicken curry plate, and their earl grey berry parfait (seriously, absolutely try this last item)."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSb2JqZ2dRRRAB,"This place is absolute gas. Never disappoints. Just order the daily special, everyday."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCeHBLMFlREAE,"Amazing, delicious meals with great portions and an awesome staff!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtcjlLRXF3RRAB,I loved the chorizo tacos this week.  All of your meals have been great!  I am so glad I learned about Clean Slate.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNldWEtTHF3RRAB,Phenomenal food. I have the best lunches!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPbUppU0lnEAE,"Great food for busy people! I'm a meal prep kind of guy, so this service is perfect for office or WFH."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHeVBDTm5BRRAB,Great people and great food!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHc0pIUlZnEAE,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHc05MLTV3RRAB,"My compliments to Dylan and his crew! We just attended an event that was catered by Clean Slate. The food was absolutely amazing! The meat choices were well prepared and very tender, and everything was very flavorful!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2X0lhbFlREAE,Not the quality of food my girlfriend and I were hoping for. We tried a few different weeks and some items were OK like the steak quinoa but some were not for us we don't like soggy food. We weren't sure how the items are intended to last multiple days. Also had problems with the delivery to Omaha food may have been sitting out too long and just seemed handled unprofessional.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2eWJPdkx3EAE,"Absolutely love their food. They can even make things gluten-free as per your request, so if you have a gluten allergy like me but also don't have time to make a decent meal during the week, these guys are for you! I've never been disappointed by their food and love the diversity of it all. Highly recommend."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxaElXY3dBRRAB,"I have been ordering the plant based meals from Clean Slate on and off for nearly a year. After all the deliveries, I can only think of one meal I did not care for......only 1 out of several! That's pretty amazing if you ask me! The customer service is prompt. The delivery drivers have ALWAYS been friendly. I would highly recommend Clean Slate!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxcElMcEdnEAE,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5b2JhWnVRRRAB,"I love absolutely everything about Clean Slate Food Co. Great customer service, awesome variety, and super healthy options. I also like that everything’s already cooked and ready to go, so all you have to do is warm it up. For someone like me who is trying to eat healthier but hates cooking, this is such an excellent option. You definitely get your money’s worth with this, and you’re supporting local. I’d highly recommend this to anyone who wants to eat better, without all the hassle."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5OHVXMlJBEAE,I have tried a lot of these types of services and am always let down. Clean slate food is doing something different it seems like they actually want me to like the meal I am eating. Thank you!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDM3RPUEx3EAE,"I just ordered my second round of meals and I'm just loving the variety Clean Slate has to offer. Eating healthy and not cooking is my jam! :)

Thanks Clean Slate for the delicious quality meals. Looking forward to having more Clean Slate Food meals!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDbC1la1pnEAE,I subscribe to their awesome weekly meal delivery service. Great variety of food and attention to detail. The owners are very nice. I really enjoy not worrying about prepping and making lunch for the weekdays because of Clean Slate. We have also done catering which was great. Highly recommend!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDbnZER1p3EAE,"We’ve used clean slate for our weekly meals and they’re always creative, delicious and the portions leave us content! They’ve catered our wedding and the food not only exceeded our expectations but it was beautiful to look at! They recently catered a private event for us and Jamen was professional, kind and went above and beyond to make sure everything was perfect. I really appreciate their prompt response and creative menus. 10/10 would HIGHLY recommend!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDa3FPQ2pBRRAB,Clean Slate has never disappointed. Each meal is a 10/10. It saves me so much time during busy weeks when I don’t want to cook. It’s also way more nutritious than a fast food drive thru. It’s even more convenient because it’s delivered to your home!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURjd05lM1p3EAE,Have ordered Clean Slate for myself a few times and as a gift for family during holidays and birthdays. Perfect gift. Their food is always better than anything I can cook at home for a reasonable price. Best catered food I think people can get in the area.
