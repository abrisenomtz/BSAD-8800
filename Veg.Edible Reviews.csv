It is so rare to have options for indulgent vegan food AND whole food plant based meals in the same spot that are both well thought out, complex and delicious. We tried the Harvest Bowl (WFPB) and the Garbage Plate (the opposite of WFPB) and they were both delicious. Desserts were half-off on Sunday. Not sure if that is typical but it was nice.

When I had an exhausting Halloween
And dozed early the night before.
I slept more than 8 hours, woke at 4,
And stayed up 4 more,
And lied in pain
For half the day
With no energy to remain
I've earned a treat
Just to feel safe
So I sought value in a trade
I can barely move,
I can barely stand,
I'd be grateful for some
strength in my hands. 
Since time isn't real
It wasn't long before
I received a text
That they were at my door
They asked me how I was
I said I'm better now
They wished me a good one
And I ran back into my house
There's a blessing on my shake,
And a heart on the box
Someone loved me today
And added two cookies on top.",Veg.Edible,4.9

What sets Veg.Edible apart is their unwavering commitment to providing dishes free from animal products, gluten, and nuts.

It's heartening to see a restaurant not only address these dietary needs but also excel in delivering flavorsome meals that resonate with passion and purpose.

The chefs at Veg.Edible are nothing short of culinary artists. Their intentionality shines through each dish, showcasing a deep-seated passion for creating food that everyone can relish. And speaking of delights, their baked goods are a revelation! Every bite of their bakery items leaves me in awe; doing this without the use of any gluten products is an incredible feat!

I looked her up online via her FB and Insta accounts,  which brought me to her website.  Stacie does pop-up food events at different locations throughout the metro, but better yet, she will make your food from scratch and deliver it. Caters, too.

She also offers pick-up options.

Her menu consists of sweet and savory Vegan + GF items: Brunch Items, Dinner, Lunch, desserts (cakes, cupcakes, brownies, scones, muffins) hush puppies w homemade vegan_GF ranch dipping sauce, on and on and on…….Come on!!!!!!

I was so overwhelmed and overjoyed by these options that I have ordered_eaten her food every week since discovering her. So much love and time goes into her food. She is dedicated + so easy to work with, plus so accommodating! How often can a GF person eat vegan “meat” options,  since many vegan chefs use Seitan as their main “meat” product. Her food is amazing!  One cannot tell that it is vegan or GF!  We have been so impressed. We did the ordering via her website, then discussed specifics via Text,  and she responds almost immediately. It is such an easy process and she is extremely punctual; exceeding our expectations!

We ordered the following GF + Vegan items and everything is full of flavor, delicious, and fairly priced: Muffins, Cupcakes, cake, decorated sugar cookies,  vegan bailey’s brownies, McRib Sand + fries, hush puppies + homemade ranch, breaded tofu fishwich + fries, buffalo mac n cheese.
