ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNIOXBmOFR3EAE,"Customer service was terrible… employee was dry, rude and it was almost like being in the store was a bother to the employee. Definitely will not go back here again. Food was mediocre."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNidF9YdzJBRRAB,Update hours on Google maps please
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURMNXRTNXBBRRAB,The foods was good.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQxOUxpUXJ3RRAB,Food taste super bland and like one step above a tv dinner.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURobHVmUTJ3RRAB,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoblAzZm9nRRAB,My first meal was delicious and heakthy!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNnVuMFpnEAE,I'm so glad they reopened; wish it weren't right next door to a cookie place. A lot of the meals are pretty high in fat so it's hard to make them fit in your macros. If you're on a cut it would be impossible. I wish there were more ground turkey options.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlNjVDX0h3EAE,Dennis was very helpful helping me pick out delicious meals to best suit my dietary restrictions and food allergies. He was very professional. The food was delicious and healthy. I HIGHLY recommend Eat Fit Go!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlcTluTGdBRRAB,"Quick, easy and delicious!  If ever I was asked what 3 words I would use to describe Eat Fit Go those 3 words would be it.  The staff is always friendly and courteous and the food has not disappointed either.  Definitely recommend to anyone that's looking for good healthy food either while out and about or not wanting to cook at home!  Keep up the good work!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1ajlEMjdRRRAB,"Súper fast. The pre made meals are convenient, and the first couple I tried were considerably better than other meal prep services I’ve tried. Definitely recommend."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1NE1fbVBnEAE,"I've been using Eat Fit Go for over a year now and I absolutely love this place. Staff is always so friendly and helpful. The meals are so tasty and macro friendly, I buy these for my lunches! They also have a pick up store option and also a free delivery option so it's super easy to get your meals! If you've never been I would definitely trying some meals, you won't be disappointed!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPbHBHcU5REAE,"We were happy to hear that they emerged after bankruptcy, because they used to be a great alternative to cooking at home and eating dinner out.  So when we saw the advertisement that they had returned to Village Pointe Mall, we were thrilled.  My dinner was the salmon alfredo.  Before bankruptcy the salmon alfredo actually had pasta noodles in it; it now has chickpeas instead of noodles.  Healthier, I get that, but it tastes like rubbery, plasticky, gummy goo.  Yes, I agree, chickpeas are filling because of this, but they taste really bad.  I tried to take every bite with the seasoned salmon to add taste, but I could barely swallow it as it still tasted like glue, or a filler; gummy, sticky, ick :(  Glad they are back but sad that their food, while at a reasonable $12.50 per item, tastes so generic and hard to swallow.  Too sad that this company has so much potential but misses the mark going cheap!  A smart decision to add shelf life by vacuum sealing; but if it doesn't taste good, that really doesn't even matter."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtMnYtald3EAE,Better off getting food in the fresh section at walmart.  Salmon alfredo was over $13 and tasted like it was a tv dinner.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtbzdhTTN3RRAB,"Will never do business with this company again. I placed an order for 6 meals. When they were delivered, two were missing from my order. No biggie - mistakes happen. Tried to find a contact number to reach customer service, but the only way to get in touch is email. Fine. Emailed the company letting them know 2 meals were missing. No response. Emailed them again several days later. Still no response. Finally, unable to get any response from the company, I disputed the overage with my credit card company. What do you know? Eat Fit Go responded to that by DISPUTING my dispute. So now I've paid for two meals that I will never receive. Well Eat Fit Go, enjoy your extra $16. You've lost a long-term customer."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHd05PeUJ3EAE,Delicious and fast
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHajZtWWVBEAE,"First time trying Eat Fit, with working, hockey, the gym, and coaching I don't have the time to cook. Their food is quality and very good! Will definitely be going back and start buying a weeks worth of food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2MU9TOUdnEAE,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhbHUybG1RRRAB,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxMnQ2MFpnEAE,Good  selection of food
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxMHF1X2VBEAE,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxdklia21nRRAB,"I would not recommend them any more.
We went there weekly spent a lot of money when my husband had Cancer. We had a gift card that we misplaced when we moved tried  to use it last week and was told we could not use it. This was unfortunate new because my husband got his cancer back and was looking forward to getting weekly meals again. They where not even willing to work with us. We love to help small businesses but unfortunately take our business Elsewhere."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxZ0xMNjlnRRAB,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLbHFYTHFBRRAB,"Super convenient format for healthy meals! Tastes good and prices are comparable to alternatives, but I like being able to just get them whenever rather than having to schedule them as you would with an online service."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5aXI3RzNRRRAB,"I used to LOVE eat fit go, ever since they switch to the vacuumed packed meals all you get it complete watery mush, almost the consistency of baby food - definitely not quality for the price you pay. I also had no luck processing my gift card online, what a waste of a gift if the online processor does not have the capability to process gift cards. Either way won’t be using my gift card anytime soon after experiencing the what I would call food for an astronaut, texture and taste was awful. SAVE YOUR MONEY do not order from here."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTdTRlblBnEAE,Great
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpeTRpY3RBRRAB,"Very nice staff, always greeted with a smile and a laugh. Great healthy environment.

Great selection as well.
The Salmon Alfredo is delicious.

Tiger recommended."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURja2FXaGlnRRAB,Love this place always helpful and for vacuumed sealed food it's good. Four cheese penne all the way.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURjeHVhaW1RRRAB,I love this store great staff and this Turkey shepherds pie I am currently eating is amazing!
ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjaC1rNBAB,Stop in here for delicious lunch  items!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzNWE2YWh3RRAB,"This location is cozy but very neat and organized. There is the option of ""buy and go"" or ""heat and eat"" in the store. The state also has a discount freezer towards the back of the store if you ask. They have a membership where you can save points for future purchases."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzNkt6Q2dnRRAB,A good place to pick up premade meals.  If your looking for a change it's a great option to eat health as well.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNeWJ1SmhnRRAB,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwc29QM0F3EAE,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwNjh5N1JREAE,I like the idea but it downt taste very good.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwb09fZTNnRRAB,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVMksyYVZREAE,Outstanding prices for healthy food!

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNZMnZ5Xy1BRRAB,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURvOXVxTDhRRRAB,"It wasn't as bad as I was expecting; I'm not super into health foods. It's a little pricey, but not bad."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvaXVxZXJBRRAB,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvd04yYm5nRRAB,"I have a great experience every time I come here (Which is usually a couple of times a week). The staff is always super friendly, and welcomes you right when you walk in.

I have tried most, if not all of the options, and for the most part are pretty good. Some of the options are little more bland/lacking in comparison to the others though. My personal favorite is the Salmon Alfredo.

I think that the pricing is fair. For right around the same amount that you would spend at a fast food place, you could get a healthy option here instead."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3azdQY3N3RRAB,Food is great! Prices are good.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRbGM3SklREAE,"Awesome place to eat, I try to go for lunch whenever I have time. The food is amazing and the staff is very friendly and helpful."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnMnZ6eTR3RRAB,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRajhDMUdBEAE,"Been to multiple locations, including downtown, but the store was closed. The hours on the website and hours of the stores don't match. The store on 135th st in Millard was closed and seems like its going out of business. I managed to find an open location one time and the food was dry."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3dGZMY1Z3EAE,We put in an order for food and unfortunately the online order did not take. We showed up to the place and the staff had no idea we placed an order. Luckily we showed them the order receipt and they had what we ordered in stock and everything was OK. The food was healthy as advertised but was pretty bland.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNndXVYQ2NBEAE,Great food and wonderful customer service!  A must try if you're trying to eat healthy and always on the go!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnMzdQbVlBEAE,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRcDRidlNBEAE,Wish it weren't so pricey but absolutely perfect health food
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnLWJ1eHpnRRAB,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRd2RMMURBEAE,not 4 me

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnOWEyTnhBRRAB,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRazQzSll3EAE,"Very clean store! Love the concept. Fresh food ready to go, never frozen. Nutrition information clearly, and proudly, displayed."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBNjZyX3pRRRAB,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBdU5yZ09nEAE,Interesting concept. Very healthy options.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnajhtV3l3RRAB,"Great customer service and the food is really good. It's a little pricey but you get to eat right, be healthy, and no cooking or tipping."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRMnEtc1pBEAE,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnMmJiY0lBEAE,Zach and Mia were very helpful.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnaVBxZG5RRRAB,Their food is honestly delicious! I'd pick their salmon over any restaurant in Omaha.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3bDdLNlBREAE,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBczRIWll3EAE,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURReU9yWVhnEAE,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURndDlUcFBREAE,By far the best customer service!! They know how to treat their customers and make situations right from the get go! Thanks Zach at this location for accommodating me! To the management I appreciate you empowering your employees enough for them to take care of your customers in the situation and not making them wait! I'd highly recommend these guys!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBeGFiWlRBEAE,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRMm9uaWV3EAE,Awesome idea. Too high of prices
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnMjltY0dREAE,the food selection is fantastic and the people are good.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnbExlYTl3RRAB,Everything was great just a little too pricey
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURncElhcTZRRRAB,"It was alright, don't appreciate the terrible judgement walking in from one of the male employee tonight. Kinda disrespectful to be dropping my change and then laughing as your saying sorry. I felt that customer service and explaining things could been better from employees. Felt like they didn't know what they were selling As I asked couple questions and then being handed a menu and being walked away. Food was healthy and good. But customer service lacked. Employees shouldn't be making fun of their customers even if they are right there. Just saying!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNndm9MU1d3EAE,"Great healthy, fresh, and quick food!

Very easy way to track calories during the work week.

Suggestion: Add your choice of hot sauce or something similar"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBanZuOXhBRRAB,This is definitely a healthy food option but you will most likely have to have a microwave handy in order to eat it on the go.  They do have some microwaves on site if you wanted to eat there.  The food is a little pricey for an every day option but they have plans that make it more affordable if that is for you.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNncEtUeU53EAE,"Stopped in today for the first time. I can't remember the guy who helped me name was but he was very friendly and helpful. Had sleeves. Great food, awesome people ! Thanks !!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnNTVXSGNnEAE,"I have to be honest, I was not sure what to expect when I first visited.  I have now been twice, and Eat Fit Go is now one of my favorite lunch stops, especially when I don't have much time.  Their salmon lunch is absolutely amazing.  It takes me all but 2 minutes to walk in grab my food and head out.  Then another 2 minutes to microwave it at the office, and it tastes just like it came out of the pan.  And the ingredient list is so simple...I can pronounce everything.  :)  You definitely have a repeat customer here!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRNkxLMThBRRAB,Great food!! Will definitely go back!!!!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRMGRLRm9nRRAB,The food is so good!
