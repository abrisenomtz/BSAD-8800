ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQzOF92X09nEAE,Great place! The decor and vibe is great and welcoming. Good choice to try all vegan for the first time. Food was amazing! I recommend the hot honee sandwich with the potato salad. Delish.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQzczZfd1NnEAE,"Went for lunch, was seated & order was taken, then the waitress comes back from the kitchen and informs us that they have no cook and didn't know when they would have one."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQzMU9hNUh3EAE,"12 Nov 24  Modern Love in Midtown Crossing (MC) is Closing.
.  Business turnover is normal. But the pace of turnover for MC appears to be accelerating.
.  Remember Arlan's, Alamo, Garbo's, Going Postal, Ingredient, Wohlner's, etal.
.  WHY?!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQzbElfVGFnEAE,"12 Nov 2024   Modern Love at Midtown Crossing has announced it is closing.
.  Modern Love provides an important alternative dining opportunity.
.  It will be missed."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQzbE8yaUJREAE,"This is the best vegan restaurant for comfort food, hands down!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzdC02SXNnRRAB,"I got the nachos for lunch and garlic Alfredo pasta for dinner the next night. That pasta was so yummy even a day later! The nachos were very filling. Food was good, the price was a bit higher than I thought, especially for Omaha. When I entered the restaurant, it reeked of sulfur, so I’m not sure if it’s normally like that. My server was very nice to me and the food came out pretty quickly. I’m happy a fully vegan restaurant exists in Omaha. Highly recommend the Alfredo pasta and nachos! I’d probably order takeaway if the restaurant still smells like sulfur."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzOWRLT0N3EAE,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzeElPTU9BEAE,"This is one of the few (basically only) vegan restaurants in Omaha and I want to give it 5 stars so bad but I've had some pretty big issues with menu availability and service. For example, one day when when I had about an hour to get in and out my table ordered a few appetizers and drinks and nothing ever came. We ended up still paying and got some food put into to-go containers but no one working offered any other solution besides us paying for the food. Also multiple times when I've tried to order speciality meals for take out (that say they're available) I'll get calls saying the items aren't and their website never updates with that info. My final concern is the rising prices and what feels like smaller portion sizes for some of their meals.

I will continue to recommend this restaurant because we need more vegan options for people and hopefully they can fix some of these issues."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURYcWVLcjdnRRAB,Food was disappointing.  I've had more gourmet vegan food from chain restaurants (ex. Cheesecake Factory).
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5dTRHN3JRRRAB,"I've had meatless nachos from coast to coast and these are BY FAR the most excellent nachos of them all. The chili burger is also incredible, especially with a side of potato salad. Highly recommend!
Edit: We went back and had Mac n Chews, fried mozzarella balls and pumpkin milkshakes. Everything was incredible as always!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNYal9DUEh3EAE,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNYcDdQaVh3EAE,Great food!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNYenVuNWZnEAE,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNYN01UVWxnRRAB,"Great find!

Went in for a business meeting and the other two people I went with recommended this place.

I ordered a Hot Chicken Sandwich (or something like that) and split the Mac and Cheese with wings with my boyfriend.

The Mac and Cheese was soooooo good. Very flavorful and the wings were so tasty.

The sandwich was delicious and the salad was great.

I really wanted the Feta and Strawberry salad but they were out of it and none of the other salads interested me.

I wish I would’ve had room for dessert as it all looked amazing.

The place is cute and prices were decent. Service was good.

I’ll definitely be back when I’m visiting Omaha!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURubGRqV2dnRRAB,"A fantastic restaurant with delicious food and great gluten-free options! Though I’m not usually a fan of tofu, the hot honey sandwich was crispy and flavorful. We also tried a spiked shake, which was excellent. The house-made sauces were a highlight—I’m not typically into ketchup, but theirs was outstanding. With great service and reasonable prices, it was an all-around enjoyable experience!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5Mk52aTRRRRAB,Did a curbside pickup and ordered their vegan cheese burger with a side order of brussel sprouts. Very good food!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURucXZDaVpnEAE,"Non vegan here, they know what they are doing fantastic service and food, presentation is not a priority for me but I really appreciate that my meal was as aesthetic as it was tasteful, it is a rarity for dine-in let alone take out was thouroughly impressed!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNucGRfSW1RRRAB,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNuenFEcWtBRRAB,"I was so excited to go to this place, but was so disappointed. What I ordered was horrible. The Goddess bowl smelled burnt and tasted burnt, including the rice (which was crunchy). It also included brussel sprouts (not on menu description) which I hate. They have GF options but not very many! And offer a GF bun, but it’s kind of pointless since the vegan meats all have gluten. The “milk”shake was okay and the curry my daughter got was decent (rice was again terrible). Decor was on point. But for a $50 ticket (that I don’t mind paying for a good vegan meal!) I left hungry. Will not visit again :("
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNuNXNuSFV3EAE,

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURIdWFpRFZREAE,"As a disclaimer, we typically only leave reviews for places that are either excellent or a big flop.  We decided to try this place while visiting Omaha due to many excellent reviews. We've been cooking plant-based for around 4 years and, honestly, skip this place. Save yourself a lot of money and cook at home. They do validate parking, though."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURIcU5IRFdBEAE,"Special place, worth the price!"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNIc2NqUGx3RRAB,"Aren't we all lucky that in the Northeastern corner of Nebraska, there's an all-vegan restaurant serving creative and delicious vegan comfort food? There's nothing to be said about good old MoLo that hasn't already been said...They're a staple of Omaha. They're a treasure of Nebraska. A bit pricey to go there more often but worth it at least a few times every now and then.

Recommendations: Fried Mozzarella, Beet Reuben, Mac and Shews, Shakes"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNIb3EzQW53RRAB,"📸Butterfly Lemonade - so yummy - and the quote on the wall at Modern Love (Omaha) ""Always take a big bite it's such a gorgeous sight.""📸 The chef prepares delicious vegan dishes that are appealing to the palate and the eyes. We enjoy chatting with Jen, the server, as she always remembers us when we come in. She is attentive, warm, and friendly. Been to both MOLOs, Omaha and NYC, and both are great!"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ3XzhQNHZnRRAB,Best vegan food around! It’s an Omaha staple!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ3XzRpTExBEAE,"100% Vegan restaurant .
Went to Modern Love for my daughter's birthday. It was quite the experience being that I'm not vegan but I did try a little bit of everything. I was pretty impressed. The food was very tasty, a lot of good flavor. I'm not a fan of tofu but it's probably a texture thing. The service was amazing. Our waitress was very knowledgeable and helpful with the menu items. I loved the dreamy atmosphere...it was comfy and relaxing."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ3MlpURDVRRRAB,"We're on our yearly trip to Omaha from Minnesota. We always go to Modern Love multiple times each visit. We did brunch twice and dinner once and ordered two dinners to drive home with. The food here is perfect and 100% vegan..Thank you to our wonderful
server, Jen who took us all three times!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ3NHZqZ2tRRRAB,"ML never disappoints. I had the hot dog lunch special today, tried the bahn mi dog and cookout dog. So good!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM3OWJTMTVnRRAB,"This was quite literally the worst experience I have ever had at a resturaunt. It took them 25 minutes to even greet me when I sat down, i had to get up & serve my own water & when I ordered my food they brought out something completely different & asked me if that was okay AFTER ALREADY BRINGING THE WRONG FOOD OUT. The food was TERRIBLE & the service was something out of this world. There are no words to describe how awful this experience was. Do not come here if you are coming to Omaha."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM3dWVIRVZBEAE,"I really enjoyed my sandwich and fries, but I found a hair in my
strawberry milkshake and they didn't even bring me a new one. The waitress avoided me despite me being high polite when bringing it to her attention. Disappointing because I had high hopes for this place."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM3bXFMTUd3EAE,"I ordered the parmesan brussels and the fettuccine Alfredo. $40 on UberEats and they won't refund me. The brussels were wrong from their prep. They didn't care enough to take all the leaves off or.. the stems?? Not to mention even cooking them. You can tell when something is cooked. Besides all of that, the seasoning? Well, just look at my photo. They were not good. Pasta was 1/4 hot arugula and a somehow cold, chewy slice of toasted bread.. but it, itself, was hot and tasted ok... until I started crying from the raw garlic. I was thinking why is this Alfredo spicy?? It's ""roasted"" garlic. Please. I can't make this up. There's a HUGE difference between soft, buttery, roasted garlic and a raw clove. I'm SO GLAD I didn't feed this to my kids. We're traveling and were so glad to find a vegan option but this was NOT it."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM3cXBIM0hREAE,Delicious food and lots of options! The vibe of MOLO is unmatched
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM3OHBHN2RnEAE,The food was good but when I was eating the bbq cauliflower wings there was a long hair under one of them. I know it was not mine. So gross. Please wear hairnets I didn’t want to finish the meal and it was so expensive. The restaurant was already closed by the time i got home with my food so I couldn’t call but please be aware.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURibWFpVEhREAE,"Quality keeps going down, i always think it will turn around, or at least stay at the same quality, but everytime I go back it gets worse. From burnt, to barely cooked, to big straight ripped off…. It has come to the point I don’t think I will ever order again. So sad to lose a vegan restaurant…."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURiaWZTeE5BEAE,"I'm not a vegetarian but I love the food here. So fresh and so tasty. I got a burger and a side of fries to go and everything was delicious! The hot honey drizzle was amazing, as were the fries that were seasoned to perfection. 🍯"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURieXZqQ3ZBRRAB,"The staff is amazing but the food is even better. I had the Caesar salad, it was so amazing with fresh capers and homemade cheese- the portions were generous and it was gone before I knew it. The staff was so nice, the waiter recently made full time and his birthday was today- he seemed very happy to be there, and assured me that he was going to celebrate."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURibktqVUpnEAE,Love this place. The food is incredible. The employees are even better. A regular stop every time I'm in Omaha.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNiZ2JYNHB3RRAB,"Fantastic vegan full of flavor food

Very nice decor
Very clean
Nice music
Nice staff
Excellent fast service"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURyNzhUbFlBEAE,Food was good. I wanted more flavor overall. The nachos were excellent.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM5dXJyRTlRRRAB,"""This vegan restaurant is super nice! The food and drinks are awesome, with flavors that really stand out. It's an upscale place, but it still feels relaxed and welcoming. The views are great, adding to the whole experience. Whether you're going for a special occasion or just a nice night out, this place won't disappoint. The atmosphere, the tasty vegan dishes, and the overall vibe make it a spot you’ll want to come back to again and again."""
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURybUt6MTRBRRAB,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNyaDkzdE9nEAE,No customer  service had to call  restaurant to get help from employee no manager only one employee  and cook. Cook came UT and didn't talk to any customer. Don't see restaurant lasting long if the keep go this way.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURobE9hTWJnEAE,"I ate here over a year ago and I thought the food was good and I actually gave it five stars at that time, but I returned a couple of days ago and ordered the mushroom Swizz burger and it was just horrible. The entire Patty was burned completely black, and they actually even burned the inside of the hamburger bun. See the pictures. Also, the fries are not fresh. They are so heavily filled with oil and very dry and heavily salted, like they've just been kept in the fryer for way too long. I couldn't eat about 3/4 of them. I asked for a lime sparkling water, and thought it was just going to be lime flavored sparkling water. Instead, it was filled with so much lime juice and was so bitter it wasn't drinkable. When I got to the restaurant with my son, no one was at the front greeting customers, and after we arrived several other customers arrived, and still no one had shown up after five minutes to greet any of the customers. I literally had to go search the restaurant for someone to seat us and the other people. I've never had such a bad experience at a vegan restaurant. Even sn impossible burger at Burger King is better than the food that I paid over $50 here. The quality of the food does not merit the price charged.  I would never come back here again. I forgot to mention that the bathrooms are almost completely dark. They have one little light on over the sink but the entire stall of the bathroom is in darkness which if someone is older and they can't see well could really pose a hazard. This is so unacceptable see photos."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNyX3NUTjRnRRAB,"Outstanding vegan restaurant! Awesome kale salad, chickpea cutlet Parmesan, tofu rancheros, chocolate swirl shake."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNyN3VhaHZnRRAB,"We arrived at 530pm on a weekday. Our party booked ahead and had 2 fettuccine with the chickpea chix addition, eggplant parm, 2 of the mushroom mashed potato dish, some kind of salad with grilled tofu.

Pros - vegan, good variety, friendly staff, not busy at all, food seemed to come in a timely manner, most of the food looked and tasted good if you didn't eat too much ... and even though I live elsewhere, this is near my dad's house.

Cons - I rarely have heartburn but I had it that night and the next morning ... boo! There was a lot of heavy food (fried and/or with a rich sauce) - most of it tasted really good (the grilled tofu tasted burnt) but was so heavy it was difficult to eat until full; either the oil was off or the food was fried too long (??? something wasn't right); the staff did zero pre-busing, so all of our empty plates and cups sat there while we visited after the meal - it's like they forgot about us. And, in my opinion, the atmosphere has unappetizing colors.

Because of the heartburn reaction, I probably will not be coming back. In the future, I might try again but find something that isn't covered in sauce or fried ... or with the burnt-tasting grilled tofu."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNyLXJPLXFBRRAB,Fantastic food: The hot new chicken and nachos were amazing; the kale salad a little too salty. Service was hit and miss; the guy leaving his shift completely ignored me while the lady who just got there was the nicest and gave me fantastic service. It looked clean but bathrooms were dark with a sticky floor. I would eat here again (that sandwich!) but just as likely to try other vegan restaurants in town next time. Parking and construction is also an issue; you can choose the garage and get validated.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNyeXV2dkxBEAE,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNyOHZtbkJBEAE,"One of the few places in town with a wide range of food options for dietary restrictions (e.g. vegetarian, vegan, GF, DF). Can be a bit pricey but is a great option for a date night or to try something new and local!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNyeUpEWnZBRRAB,"I got the hot honee sandwich, which to be fair I got it to go but it was very messy. They didn’t give me any napkins either. I also got the buffalo wings, they were just ok too. Next time I would definitely eat there instead of taking it to go."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURMaS0tdmdBRRAB,The best things were the Gluten Free Buffalo Wings and garlic Alfredo pasta 😋
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURMaS02S3hBRRAB,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURMLWRfQXpBRRAB,"We got a pint of their ice cream. While it was delicious, it looks like the workers got extremely lazy when putting it together. My pint was barely filled. Disappointed"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURMMUxfbm9BRRAB,The food was great and the service was excellent.  The location is great. Inside is cute but a bit hot and the bathrooms were very dark. Will definitely visit again. Butterfly lemonade is great!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNMXzVtMXdRRRAB,Awesome and delicious! Great service too
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNMNmNPU1hREAE,Lovely place
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNMeWFlS1N3EAE,"This place cares about allergies, especially gluten and dairy. I've never been a Vegan but this place actually had me considering it lol. Their fries are the best!!! I will be back!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNMeG8tTWVnEAE,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxMzlxSzNnRRAB,"Fullfilled the need for vegan food while passing through. Great taste, good portions. My goddess bowl didn't have the pepitas or microgreens though which was disappointing."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNMaEoyNF9RRRAB,If you are vegan or enjoy eating vegan. Highly highly recommend. Went with friends and tried several of the entrees and desserts for dinner. There was not a bad taste in the lot. Price was compostable to other all vegan restaurants. They were out of a couple of drinks and one dessert but what we got instead more than made up for it.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNMNlBQQVl3EAE,"Super allergy friendly and accommodating, vegan (dairy free), gluten free, drinks where awesome! Big portions too!! Don't remember the last time I've had a shake or Mac and cheese I haven't had to make myself, nachos where to die for, overall excellent vegan cheese"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNMa083cXRBRRAB,"From the moment I walked in, I knew I had found something special.  The staff was warm, inviting, and knowledgeable.  I had the opportunity to connect with Liam and every single thing he recommended was absolutely wonderful.  I have been a vegetarian my whole life and this Vegan restaurant is one of the best.  I highly recommend the crispy tofu; it is the best I have ever had."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR6dDctRFlBEAE,"I enjoyed my experience.  The food was great, especially for my first vegan meal."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR6emFmTEJREAE,A modern vegan eatery with beer and wine options in the city. Great use of different vegan meats to create perfect meals.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN6OGVQQnhRRRAB,"Made a trip to Omaha to make a boat purchase. That didn't work out but no regrets -- brunch at Modern Love more than made up for the boat disappointment.
We enjoyed Nachos Molo and the Seitan Beet Reuben which was more than enough for two people. Only suggestion is to request mustard for the Reuben as it could use just a bit more of a flavor kick.
Will definitely return should we be in Omaha again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN6eHZpUlJBEAE,"One of these times I will get something other than the Reuben, but it’s just SO good!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN6MHBEV0ZBEAE,"Food was okay. I love to eat vegan most of the time, but I was a little underwhelmed here. By far the best thing I had was the crispy fried tofu. But the Mac and shews were just ok and definitely felt overpriced.

Also I went home feeling bloated, which is very unusual for me."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN6cEp5dE13EAE,Absolutely best vegetarian appetizers and main dishes with a cool vibe and friendly team passionate about delivering an awesome experience.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN6dUpudUx3EAE,"We came right of our way to check this place out. There was only one server and there were a lot of lunch time customers so it was pretty slow.
We shared the Kale salad and chicken sandwich.  It was more than enough food, and they were both huge portions.  The thing we didn't like was that everything was pretty heavy in terms of the sauces and amount of oil used in cooking.
I couldn't finish as I prefer fresh food, but for comfort food, it was pretty good.
I can see why it is a popular choice.
The venue is great, and it is easy to park."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN6MEptaElBEAE,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURUeTRxMjd3RRAB,"Atmosphere is beautiful. Mushroom Swiss burger and green goddess bowl were absolutely awful. The Smokey flavor tasted like straight up butane. Not sure the cooking process but may be an inexperienced cook torching too closely to the food. Either way, highly inedible. The ingredients were quality, so it was a shame. Server spilled entire ketchup on my pants - which accidents happen, but would’ve liked to be taken care of a little more than just given napkins. Service was slow as well. Highly disappointing experience cuz I can tell there’s potential here."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURUZzhpT3hBRRAB,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURUdmM3TkZnEAE,"Great atmosphere and staff, food was great too, but I think I ordered the wrong thing for myself!  Had the chicken and waffles."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURUNmR5NW9RRRAB,"My S.O and I have been loyal patrons of this vegan restaurant for several years, drawn in by their innovative menu that seemed to promise exciting vegan versions of popular fast food items. Unfortunately, our experience has been marred by inconsistencies and poor customer service. Initially, we were thrilled with their breakfast crunch wraps, a staple for our Saturday mornings, only for them to be abruptly discontinued without explanation. When inquired, the staff dismissively claimed that the item was rarely ordered, which was surprising given its apparent popularity.

A more recent finale straw so to say came with their special copycat menu featuring vegan alternatives to well-known Taco Bell and McDonald's items. After enjoying these options for two consecutive days, we were disappointed to find the entire menu had been removed. Despite being assured by the staff that these items would remain available, they have yet to reappear. Each interaction leaves us feeling disregarded, with staff members appearing indifferent to our concerns.

While we are passionate about supporting vegan businesses, the lack of stable menu options and the dismissive attitude of the staff have led us to explore other vegan venues. We hope that in the future, this restaurant will consider maintaining popular dishes and fostering a more respectful dialogue with their patrons."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNUaDRMdzVRRRAB,"Saw this was well rated and really enjoyed on our visit. Shared nachos, french toast and a shake as a family and they were all delicious and filling! Planning to return to try more options!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNUczl6bU53EAE,Tasty vegan food and the employees are super friendly. One of our favorite restaurants.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNUNDRDcjJBRRAB,"I'm disappointed to write this review because Modern Love has long been one of my favorite restaurants in Omaha. However, our recent visit left much to be desired. My wife and I went there last night for a special occasion, but the experience didn't live up to our expectations.

The Buffalo Wings (seitan) were overcooked, hard, and dry. The Garlic Parmesan Brussels were soggy and overly oily. Even the Goddess Bowl, which I usually love, tasted quite bland. The only dish that retained any of Modern Love's usual excellence was the Eggplant Parmesan.

Additionally, our server seemed flustered and inexperienced, forgetting our orders and dropping cutlery. It was a disappointing evening at a place we once cherished."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNUamZ2Z3NBRRAB,"Although I'm not a huge fan of beets, I ordered the Beet Reuben. I would eat this every day if I could. Hands down, the best beet dish and the best overall sandwich I've ever had. The Kale Caesar was also top notch. The staff is very friendly and there was no waiting for a lunch table. 💯"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNUdWZqNy1BRRAB,"If youre so used to complex flavor this is not your kind of food. Not to say that non-vegan is better because I grew up eating vegan that made by buddhist monk and local chef in asia and they are just so addictive.

I order the garlic Alfredo dish and I felt like im eating a tub of cream and italian seasoning herbs.

I really thought this is a life changing experience because there were so much hype about this restaurants. Im just gunna say it. If you into bland vegan food or just very mild in flavor ? This is your destination.

I probably wont coming back again tho.  the quality and everything else is good but flavor wise? not so much. its just not my taste bud"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNUa1lmb1d3EAE,"Just had my first experience here (and hopefully not my last), and WOW! The staff is so accommodating (shoutout to our waitress Gabby), atmosphere is stylish, cozy, and welcoming, and the food came out so quick and SO tasty. My wish is that this place expands to more locations."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNUa2J1d3BRRRAB,"Amazing selection of entirely vegan food, great service and the food came out FAST. Reasonable prices, will definitely come here again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURqejktSEVnEAE,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURqbzRyZzBnRRAB,"I am sad writing this post. As someone who is allergic to dairy and has several friends and family members that have gluten intolerances, it’s hard to find a good place we can all eat at. I’ve been to Modern Love more than 5 times in the last 3 years and every time I’ve gone, it’s worse. They are always out of food and the quality is not what it used it be. I wish they had more consistency and gluten free options. For the price, it’s now hard to justify going back if they are out of the food that is on the menu."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURqdGZ1ZVlBEAE,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqMzREQzl3RRAB,I wish I could give this place 10 stars. I'm still thinking about it. This is the best vegan food I've had since moving out of California. I wanted to eat at this place for every single meal. So so good I'm disappointed I don't live in the area or I would be here all the time. Vegan and gluten-free options.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqNmJ1YXRnRRAB,Great vegetarian lovers restaurant
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqbm9mdjhRRRAB,"Loved this experience. Went with a large group and got to try a bunch of things. I loved all of them. Nachos were delicious. Brussel Sprouts had a yummy garlic flavor. Chickpea Parm sandwich had a delightful pesto and the same amazing tomato sauce that was on the eggplant parmesan. The waitstaff were fantastic with our large, kinda noisy group. Eating vegan in Omaha hasn't been easy. This place really made my trip."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURENzhYRGp3RRAB,"Truly exceptional food. A little slow, but quality makes up for it. Tried most of the menu, over-ate, had a great time.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREem9XXzd3RRAB,"I recently popped out for a last minute dinner at Modern Love and it was the highlight of my week. The food is vegan and unlike other vegan options, this food satisfies BOTH the comfort food cravings and the desire for light and healthy options. My typical go-to is the Mac n shews dish. You cannot go wrong with this MOLO staple. On this visit I was feeling wild and shared a plate of nachos with my friend and enjoyed every bite. I had the  passion fruit margarita and my friend had the gimlet drink and oh goodness, both were Devine. I love Modern Love staples and I’m excited to continue to try new items  in the menu. Thanks for gracing Omaha with your beauty and talent, Isa! Also! Our server was cute as a button and so great at her job and I wish I could’ve taken her home in a to-go box. 10/10"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREMXRHWHJ3RRAB,Love this place. The food is always delicious! And the staff are always friendly and attentive.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEcGN1Z09BEAE,"Never a bad meal and consistently good service. I recommend the Mac and Shews and Molo Nachos. My only gripe is that they no longer serve Il Cuore, but it's certainly not a deal breaker! A bit pricey, so eating at MoLo is an occasional treat, but it's worth every penny."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNENTVUczd3RRAB,"In my experience, vegan restaurants are a hit or miss. Not Modern Love. After recently going vegan and feeling utter despair at the lack of available plant based options around, Modern Love has become my saving grace. Not only is everything on the menu vegan, they have gluten free options as well. Plus everything there is delicious, with their Ruben being my new favorite. Some people might scoff at the price, but you really can’t find food like theirs anywhere else. Plus it’s super cute inside!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEcGFpNkpBEAE,Sadly disappointed. Was up to try some vegan food but it did not deliver. The biggest thing was that these were recreations of non vegan dishes to be vegan. Almost everything had an aftertaste that just left me feeling disgusted about myself. I wish there were more options that were not re-creations. The atmosphere was pretty cool loved the purple vibes
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEb1lUdGZBEAE,Lives up to the hype! Best fettuccine alfredo I've ever had. I do wish they had NA cocktails and wine.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEcHRpcGtRRRAB,"I went here with a friend and loved the vibe. Service was fairly quick, and the waiter was nice. We ordered poutine as an appetizer, and it was delicious! I tried their Mac ‘n Shews, which was good, but a little much if you ate the whole bowl. My friend ordered the Goddess Bowl, but it was just OK. Pesto could’ve been better, but the Brussel sprouts were nice. Overall, the food was pretty good. Left full and satisfied!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEbUkyWDF3RRAB,"The food was mediocre. Everything we had outside the seitan wings was underseasoned, especially noticeable on the fries. Trim the stems out of your Brussel sprouts. The cheesecake was pretty good.

Service was okay, our server disappeared for 7 or 8 minutes after our food was delivered and our water glasses sat empty during that window.

Atmosphere wasn't great, the place feels like a business major's idea of a restaurant."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNENk9Yb3Z3RRAB,This was my first time here. I ordered the seitan wings and the Reuben Sandwich were fantastic. The food was quick and service was attentive and fast. Great place to eat I can't wait to try other menu options.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEeU5fd29BRRAB,"Our visit was so disappointing. The bathrooms were dirty. The water cups we were given were also dirty and had lipstick on them. The food lacked flavor as well and it was really expensive.

Overall a bad representation of vegan food. Just a bad experience overall."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM5dXNqSWZ3EAE,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM5bE92UDNRRRAB,The food is great! Service is horrible!!!!! Sat here for an hour w no food....25 min before someone took our order...watched other people's order taken that came in after. Makes me sad to think service is sooo terrible I don not want to come back here.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURkMjVIWHp3RRAB,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURkODlUaFl3EAE,"Sat at the bar with a non vegan buddy. Had some beers, had the fried mozzarella, and had Brussel sprouts to start. The Brussel sprouts were amazing. I ordered the seitan beet Reuben. It was really delicious and filling. The number of fries they give you are out of those world and delicious. Ultimately, everything was super delicious. I just think the mozzarella could be a little more melty like miyokos. Service was awesome."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURkd3ZuOFdnEAE,I wouldnt know how the food tastes. I walked in at 7pm on a Wednesday night and the bartender told me the kitchen is too overwhelmed and not taking any more food orders for the night. Place was not packed.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNkdmRuN3J3RRAB,"Unfortunately I am not pleased with the experience of Modern Love as of 2-16-2024, 6:10pm.  I called in my order( seitan swiss burger and fries). It was not ready on time which was fine, I understand when things get busy, NONE THE LESS, if I must wait a extra 20minutes can the food (fries and burger) be hot? Those fries were so burnt and cold it made no sense. As I tried calling from the parking right outside I could get no one to answer the phone....it was cold so I headed home. Come on Modern Love for those prices I believe you can at least serve flavorful HOT non burnt food. It's 2024.......no substandard ANYTHING. DO better.👍"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNka2R2dzN3RRAB,"This is a difficult review to write since I've enjoyed coming here the last few years, but now it seems that the quality of everything is really slipping during our last couple of visits.  Food: the seitan wings are always a solid winner and is doing a lot of heavy lifting for the remainder of this review.  They drastically changed the reuben sandwich; it used to be very convincing and full of flavor, but now it's just a bland beet sandwich.  The bread that came with the alfredo was just awful; it tasted like an ashtray that lingered around all the way home.  The menu selection has also been reduced, which is fine if the remaining items continued to be good, if not better.  Service: it's a revolving door for servers; they're always new and confused, and they don't stick around.  Atmosphere: all the hanging plants along the windows are dead and rotting, which is rather unappealing to look at while eating.  All these issues point to a significant management problem.  I'd really like so see this place to excel, but, man, things are not looking good at the moment."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNkbHRURDFnRRAB,"Love, love, love Modern Love! The food is fabulous, the servers are friendly, and the prices are reasonable."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR0bDhiRXlRRRAB,"The food is OK. Being the only real vegan restaurant in Omaha I wish this place was better. The food is Good, but you can tell it is not made to order. Example, we order the nachos with chorizo. You could tell the vegan chorizo was premade and the chips were not fried fresh. We have high standards when we pay premium prices."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR0d1lTNFJREAE,"pretty good food if you don't mind the sulfur smell in the restaurant, the aggressive upselling (new server), forgetting the pen dropping off the check, not filling waters often, forgetting a sauce we ordered and having it end up on the check, and having 3 different servers serve you during your stay"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN0bUphVjV3RRAB,Called the restaurant twice yesterday. Left a message for callback. Also sent a message to the email that they requested if you had questions. No response what so ever!!! I have a gift card to use or I would never go back. This exact situation happened to my husband and I about 2 yrs ago. Poor business practice. I worked in the service industry for many many years and NEVER would I completely ignore a potential guest.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUROdDlpTll3EAE,"RATIONAL REVIEW of Modern Love

FOOD: Vegan restaurant with 5 main entrée dishes. I got the Eggplant Parmesan, which arrived warm, not hot. The flavors were good barring the garlic bread which was burnt and tasted similar to how hot tar smells. The drink choices are great, and I enjoyed the rhubarb tea!

Service: extremely slow on this particular occasion. We arrived at 6:50 and did not see our food until 8:20. Waitress was clearly overworked.

Atmosphere: tables and chairs were very petite, atmosphere was trendy and well decorated. Bathroom was pretty gross.

Overall I shall never return, but at least I got a chance to review it!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUROZ2U2cGtRRRAB,Never disappoints! More delicious every time  I’m here. My odd requests were met with no issues. Thank you Heather for the patience and great service!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtbjRMTG9BRRAB,"Sad. You want only vaccinated people to eat your food indoors? Why exactly? First of all you want to be a “vegan restaurant” these vaccines are not vegan. Second, why are you in fear of those who choose what to do with their own medical health over their “own” body? Are you also looking for people that have absolutely no diseases to not eat your food as well?? Would you like to see all medical information of those coming in to eat your food? If you love your non vegan injections so much, tell those who created these patented injections to be liable for their own product, which they are not. ~ Since when is an ""experimental"" injection a cure?? Also many people who have had Covid healed naturally and have a thing called immunity, however it seems you are all discriminating against our God given immune systems, and also against healthy people as well who do not live their lives by lab created synthetic forced upon injections. ~ Please respect all people and never ever force things upon anyone especially by the use of fear."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUROLU12M0N3EAE,Had some of the best nachos. I would highly recommend Modern Love for great food and service.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUROdVAyZmtRRRAB,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQxbl9HMUxBEAE,"Amazing, delicious, and vegan???? I was never really one for going out of my way for vegan food but this place consistently knocks it out of the park! Great staff and atmosphere. A little pricy but so worth it!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQxcjRXZndnRRAB,"I had a mushroom burger and my wife had a salad. Both were delicious.
Staff seemed very friendly.
Price is a bit higher than regular food, but the quality is there."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQxX2ZpaXJnRRAB,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRaG9QTU9BEAE,"Getting seated is always hard because the food is so good. They seem to be busy all the time. The waiting is worth it. Food seems to get better every time we visit. ""BBQ Wings"" are delicious. Gnocchi is incredible."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQxb2JtclZnEAE,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoOEthbVFnEAE,"We've enjoyed MOLO's food and service since it opened at its original location, but the service has become complacent... On our last visit, on Sun 2/26/23, the server was very inattentive, had no communication, and had a lack of urgency. We had to flag her down for coffee refills (repeatedly, and wait almost 40 min the first time) or anything else we needed. Added to our coffee woes, this restaurant doesn't seem to have the means to simply warm up icy creamer for our coffee. She made it seem like an impossible and unreasonable task. In addition, by the time we got the butter (which we had to ask for as well) our waffles were as cold as the refrigerated butter and syrup we were given. There's a few things more that reflect bad service, but I'll stop complaining. Most of MOLOs food is great (when it's on time and not cold), but their service is lacking. I expect much much more when I have to pay $21 a plate and am then expected to leave a non-obligatory tip (which I did leave by the way). Not all service costs the restaurant money, just some attention and consideration. This has been experienced before this visit. Isa, your staff as a whole needs formal server and customer service training. Taking my order and bringing out my food with a smile isn't enough."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMxazVtdjFBRRAB,"Stopped here for some dinner this evening and not only had delicious food, but loved the service! Lynn told us she was the only server there that night, but was flying from table to table with a great attitude and we were never kept waiting. Would absolutely stop here again the next time we pass through!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMxb2VuN3p3RRAB,I love the food. Especially the fried mozzarella and the dessert menu. Entrees are okay. I think some of the tables are too small though
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMxcnA3cEhREAE,An absolute gem. The seitan wings are bananas good. The cocktails are delicious. I highly suggest their mac and cheese but you could literally close your eyes and point to an item on the menu and be delighted.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMxNlBQdmlnRRAB,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMxcU0ycHl3RRAB,"I've eaten here many times. It's kind of the gold standard for vegan restaurants. Even though I almost always get the buffalo Mac and cheese, I love that their menu changes regularly. Chickpea Parmesan is another favorite. The vibe is great if dining in, but I tend to get it to go more often."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMxc01hYUhBEAE,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURWNTd2bVJREAE,It was good food but the service was lack luster for the amount you end up paying for the food. Some would make the argument that well it's vegan it's going to be expensive I just didn't find the value in it.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURWazhHa0NREAE,Got the fried oyster mushrooms and brussel sprouts and it was a gastronomical delight. So satisfying and one of those meals that must be danced in the air between bites because it's so good.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURWd29YYkd3EAE,"I have had vegan food in over 30 states, and Modern Love is one of the best I have had. Their sandwiches are excellent."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURWcUxmb2ZnEAE,"I had shrooms and grits.  It was so good, plus gave me ideas on how to improve my grits at home. Thanks for inspiring me."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNWd18yMDNBRRAB,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURsODVHM29RRRAB,No meat here
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURsdVpiTGVBEAE,"Wonderful experience! My mother and I went here for a fun girls day brunch, the server, Sam, was very nice and made sure we got our food fast because we were on a schedule, great service, amazing atmosphere, and amazing people working there, THANKS SAM YOU’RE THE BEST ✨"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNscjlYWERBEAE,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNsejdmR2NBEAE,Sooooo good! And the place is super pink and cute 💖💖
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNsMTVyYzlBRRAB,I've loved everything I've eaten or drank here. Every time!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNsNjQ2eFNBEAE,After being told that it was ready it wasn't I waited an extra 40 minutes
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNscmFfTTNRRRAB,"My third visit and my second carryout order.  I cannot say enough positive things about the food and service.  We preordered a Thanksgiving Feast and we were not disappointed with the quality.  Just one word of warning.  Be careful with the amount you eat.  I'm discovering vegan food is unexpectedly heavy.  What would seem normal portions are actually more than enough.  I recommend you eat 1/2 of what you receive and save the rest for the next day.  This restaurant is a worthwhile family outing, or an intimate couple rendezvous."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNsd3FuVmR3EAE,Impressive vegan spot in steak town  Omaha!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNsN09LYUp3EAE,Absolutely great vegan restaurant with LOTS of options. The Reuben (from siepan and beet) was outstanding and everyone raved about their chosen dishes.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4OVpud0x3EAE,"Bright capacious premises. Colour scheme was incongruous for a vegan restaurant or any restaurant  more  nightclub. Staff make everything they  do seem like an imposition. The varied menu offered great promise but the execution was poor . Food was  far too heavily flavoured, over-salted and hard to finish. Did the chef taste  what's put on the plates?  Metal ""plates"" are not clever just cheap and crass. Such a shame that a vegan restaurant falls so far short!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURGbjlyUEFnEAE,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURGdnE2V25RRRAB,Placed an order online and drove 30 minutes to pick it up to find out the order had been canceled and money refunded since they were lunch items vs. brunch. Please fix the site so it doesn't allow you to order something that isn't available.  Staff didn't seem bothered that I was upset by it.  Placed a new order and waited for it there.  It was delicious as always.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURGOHFTV2VnEAE,"Jaw-droppingly delicious.  Absolutely lives up to the reputation, even WOWing the skeptical meat eaters.  There is excellent variety in the menu so there's something to appeal to everyone and every mood.  Gorgeous decor with a really lovely atmosphere.  A teensy bit on the pricier side BUT portions are extremely generous and so, so tasty.  Highly recommend and is definitely my favorite restaurant in Omaha."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNGaGJqTXNnRRAB,"100% vegan 90% scratch-made Great atmosphere very chill and mellow. The vegan food is great and they have amazing vegan  shakes and ice cream. Would recommend to anyone vegan, vegetarian, or anyone just curious about vegan food and desserts."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ1cG9UektnEAE,Nice Vegan fare. Straightforward dining experience. Can hold a pleasant conversation while enjoying the Chicken fried oyster mushrooms or a vegan Reuben sandwich. The cashewnut ice-cream was wonderful.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ1dkxXMmZnEAE,"The food was great tasting.  The pumpkin praline cheesecake was divine.  Oh and I'm not one to enjoy nachos, but they were fantastic!  Do stop here to eat."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ1dk1TUGl3RRAB,"After over five days of searching through online restaurant recommendations, I was fortunate enough to stumble across Modern Love. I walked the 45 minutes from my hotel and eagerly joined the small gathering of brunch goers waiting for the restaurant to open.

What I liked:
- My first impressions of the venue were very good. Though from the outside it appeared to be small, Modern Love was spacious inside with many seating options from chairs to booths
- The waitress came and offered me a menu right away
- The meal was phenomenal and pure perfection! It was only salad, and yet, it seemed like so much more. Never have I had anything like it and I doubt I will again. The salad was huge to the point that I was a bit overwhelmed when I first saw it. The lettuce was crisp, the croutons were very flavourful, the tofu was moist, the dressing was creamy and slightly tangy. The other toppings complemented the salad perfectly
-The waitress was new, but showed great initiative by offering to ask for clarification from her colleague when she was uncertain of an answer
- Prices were very reasonable
- Washroom was clean
- Parking available out front

What could be improved:
- It took quite awhile for my food to be served. At least 30 minutes, not including the 10 minutes leading up to my order being taken. I was in no hurry so it wasn’t a problem for me but I can imagine that if I was on a fixed 1 hour lunch break, this would have been concerning
- At no point did anyone asked me if I had enjoyed my meal, which was really unfortunate because I absolutely loved my meal
- I was still holding my fork and had probably just swallowed my last bite when the waitress came over and asked if I wanted the bill. Asking if I wanted dessert, which I did, was an afterthought for her. I am not certain if this is how things are done in Omaha though, as this was the second time this happened in the past week.
- There was a dueling music battle going on in the restaurant and it was unpleasant. First there was the restaurant's main speakers and then there was the blaring music from the kitchen. At one point the main speakers were turned off and all I could hear was the kitchen music
- I probably would have ordered soup, but it wasn’t ready. Seeing as how the restaurant opened at 11:30am, they should have started setting up earlier so that it would be part way ready to go by opening
- Not all dessert options are listed on the menu

My meal at Modern Love was by far the best meal I had while visiting Omaha, and I can imagine that if I lived in Omaha I would become a regular."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ1cU9MLV9nRRAB,Service is great. Food is healthy and very delicious.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM1MDV6VXhnRRAB,"Very good vegan food. I especially recommend the nachos. The cashew cheese sauce is great!
I don’t recommend the “chicken” tofu sandwich. It was bland."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM1X2R1SEZBEAE,"We recently went to Modern Love this past weekend with one of our friends who was visiting from CA, this was our first time trying Modern Love.
We were greeted right as we entered, the staff was super friendly but things started going downhill when we got to our table.

As we were waiting to order I saw a roach crawling up the booth (where our friend was sitting) We wanted to show
him a good time while he was in town and seeing this little bug was the first red flag. I didn’t care too much about it, we were still having a good time but it was concerning. I informed our server of the bug I just killed with the cloth they provided & requested a new one. She apologized for the issue and provided a new cloth, again it wasn’t that big of a deal.

Our friend ordered some appetizers
When it was time to pay, we realized we were charged for the wings we never received. We mentioned this issue to our server, she removed those off our orders. This was red flag number 2

However, the food was sooo good.
Highly recommend getting Roasted Garlic Alfredo with Grilled Portobello

We weren’t too upset about our experience but the service was meh.
It would’ve been nice if the server offer some sort of discount just for the roach issue and forgetting our oder.
I probably wouldn’t come back and dine in for a while.
I am bit bummed out about our first experience because I did want to come back and bring my partner for date night but after what we experienced on  Friday. I’m only doing takeout.
Overall the food is fire AF."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM1d2NPckFnEAE,"My family and I stopped in on short notice for dinner. We were pleasantly surprised since vegan cuisine is not our regular go-to for meals. We enjoyed the cauliflower, the ""burger"", and ""chicken"" sandwich immensely. The vibe of the restaurant was perfect for our evening out too. We were able to enjoy each other's company in a relaxed environment while enjoy our meals. A friend who joined us who is vegan thoroughly enjoyed her meal as well saying it was top notch!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURaajluMmFREAE,I've been coming to Modern Love for years because of the delicious vegan options.  They are always on top of their food. Love having vegan options in Omaha
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM1eU0tbmdRRRAB,"Being a midwesterner, I am continually surprised by how delicious vegan food can be. If only I could grill tofu as well as them, I'd go vegetarian as well."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURadDZYR2pnRRAB,"Used to be a great option for vegan food.  Service and food have gone downhill over the last few years. Menu remains the same with little to no updates, minimal seasonal variety as well. Online ordering system has issues the last several times we’ve utilized. 3-5 day wait for a refund if going that route. Overall better options elsewhere and overly hyped."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURaM2V1cUF3EAE,"Fantastic vegan food! Been going here for years, love the chicken bacon ranch sandwich, wings, desserts! Can’t really go wrong with anything on the menu! Thanks for being here for us vegans"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURadVlQR1lREAE,"Best Vegan Food I've ever had, and among the best food I've had anywhere.  Vegan Fine ish dining at its finest."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURabVl6THd3RRAB,Very cool place with awesome food! The buffalo cauliflower in and of itself is worth coming back for.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURaM3V2eU5REAE,"One of the best vegan restaurants I’ve ever been too. My wife is Gluten Free and Dairy Free, while I am not, and there is something for everyone on the menu. Don’t let the “vegan nature” of this restaurant scare you from trying something. The Chik’n Bacon Ranch sandwich was delicious, and the nachos were really good (brunch menu)."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURaanMtODNBRRAB,I expected a little more flavor with the French toast. The other two enjoyed their food. I am not vegan so that is probably why I was not terribly impressed. But at least I tried it. The staff was wonderful and the interior beautiful.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURaeHY3WmhBRRAB,"The customer service here is outstanding. I emailed with a question regarding ingredients and didn’t really expect an answer, but I received a prompt, detailed and kind answer. I called once and wasn’t able to reach anyone and they called me back! All other interactions service wise have been wonderful too. This is such a rarity! 15/10 on customer service and outstanding food too!!! Highly recommend."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURaM0syYVhBEAE,"Wonderful inviting atmosphere. Great service, amazing food and drinks!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURaektmVXJ3RRAB,"11/22/23 I ordered mushroom fried chicken, extra crispy, and glam chowder. Received my food and walked over to Turner park. Excited to eat, I opened my food and realized that they gave me tofu fried chicken. I don’t eat tofu. Had to walk back across the street to get the correct order. Mushroom wings were hot but soup was now cold. Disappointing. 11/24/23 I ordered buffalo cauliflower Mac n shews. Received my order and this time I checked before I left the restaurant. This time I received just the buffalo cauliflower. Once again, sent the food back to be corrected. Both times the person taking my order, two separate people, made the ticket for the wrong item. I enjoy the atmosphere but perhaps the music is too loud (stretching here). I do know that the visit tonight, the young lady who took my order was probably more concerned about if there was any “mismade” food orders because as she stated to her fellow coworker she needed food. Overall I’m disappointed with the service. The food is good for vegan cuisine in the Midwest but the service used to be a lot better and the employees used to be more attentive. Hopefully the young lady got to eat the cauliflower buffalo wings. :("
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURaNUtySDZ3RRAB,"This place was hype by all the people in the vegan community in Iowa but came here today to get disappointed. The chick bacon and ranch sandwich was the only good thing we had today. Crispy and full of flavor. Potato salad was lacking seasoning. We also got the Parmesan sandwich which was very bland,very thin in size and not crispy at all(fries were good). The French toast with strawberries was lacking flavor. It was just bread with eggs no cinnamon or any flavor not even a strawberry sauce ( the menu says saucy strawberries)just raw strawberries and whipped cream. The last plate was the chick and waffles. This plate was also very bland. The seitan was not crispy and lacking seasoning the waffles  We also ordered a pumpkin shake which was not mixed all the way. The flavor was bland and for $12 was definitely not worth the money. All together we spend about $90 plus tip. Our server was no where to be found. She pretty much took our order and never came back to check on us, the orders servers brought our food out. I think she forgot about our drinks bc they came after our food came out. The restaurant is beautiful but they need to get their kitchen in place. I would come back for the chick bacon ranch sandwich and their fries only."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURaNk1TVHZnRRAB,"Food was great, the service was spotty. We weren't texted when a table was ready. We had to ask for silvestres. But the staff was nice."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNaLTZEdE1BEAE,"Uh may zing!
Vegan deliciousness!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNaemRITERBEAE,Phenomenal vibe
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNaaWNQRkV3EAE,The Goddess Bowl was delicious!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNaOGR1WjJBRRAB,"The food was solid vegan classics (we got the buffalo mac and the chilaquile), and the drinks were fine to good.

The service was poor. We were seated at the only table in our section without cutlery (we took some from the neighboring table), and we were completely done with our appetizers by the time our drinks came out. Our server never bothered to remove our appetizer plate from the table, which made for crowded eating on a small two-top. She also didn't ask us if we wanted dessert (we did), and brought us our check almost literally the minute we finished our food.

All in all, we wouldn't go back. It's uncomfortable to be treated like an inconvenience in a restaurant that's barely half half."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNac2J5VUNBEAE,I am not a vegan and generally the people I take to Modern Love are not either. We always find something amazing. They also have gluten free dishes. The whiskey chocolate shake is to die for.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCMlBYQ2h3RRAB,"Review update as of Sept 2023:

This place used to have phenomenal food and service. Two years ago I met my girlfriend here for a first date and we used to be regulars. My girlfriend is vegan and I am vegetarian, so we are familiar with the way good vegan should taste. This place still has a special place in our hearts, but the food quality has gone down considerably. Last night we got two appetizers and two entrees. The mozzarella bites tasted like some sort of foodscience experiment and the marinara was very acidic. My girlfriend got the Reuben Sandwich and three bites in said ""This is really not good."" The sandwich had a hodgepodge of ingredients that didn't go together, and was very dry, very little to no dressing. The bread was mushy too. I got the garlic Alfredo and soldiered through it but the pasta was blatantly overcooked, the Alfredo was done very poorly, and I'm not even convinced there was basil in the pesto. Additionally, the whole dish was served on a bed of fresh arugula and spring mix, which meant the hot pasta and sauce wilted the greens and forced you to have bites that were a mix of bad Alfredo and pseudo-wilted salad greens. The toast was super dry and the grilled portabella mushroom was genuinely burnt beyond recognition. The mushroom was so black and charred, I couldn't even tell it was a mushroom and the flecks of burned mushroom permeated into the entire dish, making it taste like a mess of cashew cream, old spring mix, and grill trap gunk.

That being said, they still nail all the dessert items and the strawberry milkshake was phenomenal. Otherwise it's not worth going unless you're there for just cheesecake and a cocktail.

This place used to be amazing and I'd take my non-vegan friends to show them how great a full-vegan restaurant could be. After last night, I'm embarrassed I paid over $110 for this meal and super disappointed with it.

I realize this is a scathing review, and that is not usually my MO; however, it was so bad I don't think I'll be going back. My best guess is that they hired all-new, ill-trained kitchen staff and the old chef left and was replaced with someone who lied to the owner and promised they could make everything the old chef made (they can't). I say this because the menu items were objectively not well thought-out and the food was not cooked well, so a double whammy there in terms of overall suck.

If you want to go here, just get a cocktail and a cheesecake and spare yourself the waste. Hopefully the quality improves."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNaMlBxLUN3EAE,Only complaint would be that the TVs are never on.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNabUxUUVNBEAE,Awesome food but not always great value.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNaaU9fMGJREAE,"Incredible vegan culinary experience! Such a great hand crafted vegan menu!! Super friendly staff, and great atmosphere to enjoy healthy and delicious vegan fair. Because everything is whole foods and not just substitutes, it does take a bit to get your food, but it is worth the wait. We look forward to coming back and trying more!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNaaU9yNjdRRRAB,Super cool spot. Delicious food and one of the only all-vegan restaurants in Omaha. I would recommend to everyone for a fantastic meal.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNwajhud3p3RRAB,Absolutely love this place. Started going when they were in their tiny place by oleavers but now they have a bigger spot to cater to their following. Just tried the spinach and feta pastry and it was to die for 10/10 recommend!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNwMDYtd1J3EAE,I really hate leaving a non 5-star review on a vegan restaurant but we found the food to be extremely bland. I had heard so many amazing things and ordered all the food that was highly recommended. But we were really quite disappointed with the lack of flavor. I would absolutely give it another shot when back in Omaha!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNwaGJEMGtBRRAB,

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4bWVuRE53EAE,"Liam and Haley are probably the most unprofessional servers I’ve ever seen, was enjoying my food for them to be treating others terrible. Undeserving of their position. Made my food taste terrible."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNwMExHTzBnRRAB,10/10 would highly recommend! The cauliflower buffalo wings are delicious! Every single dish I’ve tried has been great aswell!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURKajhPR01BEAE,"This is a restaurant where you might not notice that it’s also vegan. This is the type of restaurant all vegan restaurants should strive to be. This is the gold standard, this is what 10/10 looks like."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURKLTRDcTRBRRAB,"I've loved Modern Love even before I was vegan. It's one of my favorite places to indulge for good vegan  food!
I've never had a complaint, I just want to give some feedback :)
One of the staple menu items me and my partner have been ordering throughout us being Modern Love customers, the Philly, has left the menu some months back and we've been sad at it's departure. We have also enjoyed their Turkiclub sandwiches (which may have been limited time), but another staple item that has departed is their breakfast crunch wrap. The crunch wrap left a few months back, as well, or perhaps earlier this year, but we had been ordering it on weekends pretty regularly last fall. My partner asked while picking up an order recently about if the crunch wrap would be coming back, and was told by a staff member it was a very temporary item and made it sound like it wasn't on the menu for more than a short time which definitely was not our personal experience. Our area does not have a great deal of vegan breakfast variety, so we were sad to see a breakfast favorite leave.
We aren't too heartbroken, as we know ML has regularly updated or cycled their menu, but with these menu items gone with seemingly no return any time soon, the times we would have gone to order from ML has reduced quite significantly."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURKcGE3M2Z3EAE,"Super overpriced and quality is going downhill. I’ve eaten in where we were completely forgotten about for over an hour and our food was either burnt, cold, or missing altogether when it finally came out. I’ve also had it delivered where they didn’t include about $20 worth of items and didn’t bother refunding even though they said they would."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURKaHFEZUp3EAE,"This is a restaurant where you might not notice that it’s also vegan. This is the type of restaurant all vegan restaurants should strive to be. This is the gold standard, this is what 10/10 looks like.

The only ‘area for improvement’ we encountered is that for Sunday brunch, you can’t order any appetizers until the last hour of them being open, from 2-3pm. At that point, why even have these items on the Sunday brunch menu if they are only offered right before close? You also can’t order desserts, even to-go during this time. So while would think twice about coming for Sunday brunch (get the grits), I would recommend any other time."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURKdXNHYzB3RRAB,"My first time eating at Modern Love and it was fantastic. It had been on my list for a long time (even before moving to Omaha) and I’m so glad I did. Had the Seitan Beet Rueben sandwich, which was fantastic. Really nice texture and flavor. The side I chose was the potato salad, which is definitely one of the best I’ve had. I was also able to taste the Chickpea Cutlet Parmesan, which was incredible! Very generous portions of food so you won’t be leaving hungry. I look forward to coming back for dinner soon and trying other items on the menu because I saw many others that looked really good. Trust the reviews - this place is the real deal!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURKbkpfVS1nRRAB,One of my wife and I's go-to places for date night. Also they take eco stuff pretty seriously. Lots of recycling and composting going on. Plus take-out wares are compostable.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURKdU9fZVdBEAE,A place with a unique flavor of food. Definitely recommend it.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURKNFBldHFnRRAB,The only regret here is that we don’t live in Omaha. Best vegan food we’ve had outside of the coast(s). Seriously. Don’t skip the oyster mushroom calamari or any salad (even the lettuce is amazing). Stop reading already and just go. It’s worth it.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURKd05feUpnEAE,"We stopped here with our two little doggies and our bunny, they hung out on the lovely lawn while we waited for our super delicious carry out!

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNKNV9QNEt3EAE,"LOVED this restaurant!!! I am still talking about it weeks later after finding this gem on a work trip. Vegan menu is full of immense creativity and executed with a lot of flavor. I like how they offer house made protein options VS fake processed meats/dairy that so many vegan places do. Allergen conscious menu. Atmosphere is lovely and comfortable. Service was on point and helpful. I had the reuben with salad option and potato salad. Reuben was amazing and huge. Salad was super fresh and had a lovely tahini dressing. One of the best meals I have eaten. I was appreciative to get nourishing, healthy, and delicious food while on a work trip."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNKLTQ3Y2h3RRAB,"Amazing vegan food. A must stop if you're in Omaha! Even non-vegan eaters enjoyed the food. Lovely atmosphere, great place for a date night."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNKaGVMc0VREAE,I ordered two mac & shews bowls and they cost $50. Look at the amount like how stingy could you be in the portioning. Literally took 8 bites and it was gone. Not to mention the wait time was over an hour. The wait time i’ll get over since I’m patient but the food portioning and price? Absolutely not.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNKa1pUZ2lRRRAB,The food is absolutely incredible! One the best vegan restaurant I’ve tried ✨

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR4eThHQXpBRRAB,"Being a vegan this is my all time favorite restaurant in Omaha. Food is fantastic and the menu changes, so you have different options. Try the shakes they are sweet and decadent. The fried chicken tastes so close to the real thing 10/10"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR4clp6X1JnEAE,"I visited Modern Love twice while I was visiting Nebraska. First, I had their Chick’n Bacon Ranch & it was filled with so much flavor! So delicious.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR4bFpmbjlnRRAB,"Have visited a handful of times now, & the food is pretty amazing! I am a meat eater but love trying different things and this place does amazing job at making things taste like meat!
The wait staff & bartenders are nice but this is where I think this place is lacking. Most wait staff are lacking in the basics. I usually only see my waiter when I order and when we get the check. Don't usually get refills or just checking on how we're doing mid meal.
Most staff I've had aren't very knowledgeable on the menu nor very passionate on the food. I don't get a whole lot of excitement.
But anyways just my feedback. None of this are deal breakers as I still plan to frequently visit because the food is that good!"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR4NVBETE9nEAE,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR4c1BTN193RRAB,"We loved our first visit about 6 years ago at the former location. This had the potential to be another good experience. Unfortunately, the waitstaff didn't share with us which items they were out of. For context, it wasn't a weekend; it was a Monday evening at 7 p.m. Being a relatively small menu, it happened that the top three items we chose were not available. We ordered anyway, with much less enthusiasm. And those lower expectations were met. Nachos are fine. The Reuben sandwich was also fine. The potato salad has either brown mustard or horseradish, so it's not for everyone. We ended up taking most of it home for the friend who couldn't make the dine-in experience with us. 😬 We'd like to go again, but we will definitely be caing first. I had driven in from Texas to visit my friend, and this was a special meal, being both of our 40th birthdays. Bummed, but it happens."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4aDU3d2Z3EAE,Amazing vegan desserts! I will likely come back to this place when I'm in town again.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4OWFXdDdRRRAB,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4OWJUMTVRRRAB,"Very poor service. Before leaving, we asked the server for a box because we did not eat over 50% of our meal. We walked out of the restaurant and accidentally forgot the box so immediately returned only to be informed our server had put our takeaway box in the trash. Unsure what the logic was with this? No apology was provided and the restaurant did not compensate for their error. If you make a mistake that’s acceptable but when you don’t own up to it and rectify the error it’s unacceptable and results in lost business. We won’t be returning or recommending this restaurant to others."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXazZQb3RRRRAB,"Everyone's been raving about this restaurant and as much as I love meat I did not miss it in the mac and cheese meal. I think there was like a breaded fried tofu. At least that's what it looked like but it tasted amazing. I will definitely be eating there again.

So Google asked me to update my post. I have since had the eggplant parmesan and it was great. I also had a vanilla shake and enjoyed it too."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4aE1IdVBREAE,"Extremely impressed with this vegan restaurant. The seitan wings were exceptional without trying too hard to be ""chicken"". I also got the fried mushroom entree and was impressed. The shakes are extremely rich."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHcTRHckp3EAE,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdi1xNmVnEAE,"Last night, my bestie and I came in to celebrate her birthday dinner.  We had a such fantastic experience with it being her first time. We had a really great start to the dinner with some Firecracker Broccoli and Fried Mozzarella. The Firecracker Broccoli was fantastic and super crispy and crunchy in all the right ways with just enough spice to flavor not burn you out. However  all of the flavors on the plate balanced nicely. The Fried Mozzarella balls, will replace any idea of what vegan cheese in your mind is with this forever. Creamy and smooth but encased in the most delicious crunchy goodness that has never tasted better than these. They’re so good you’ll forget they are even vegan and with the perfect marinara to balance their richness.

For entrees, I had the Roasted Garlic Alfredo with a Chickpea Cutlet and she had the Chickpea Cutlet Parmesan. All I can recommend over and over again is the Chickpea Cutlet will totally make you happy in so many ways. It’s chewy, crispy and smooth all in the same bite when mixed the Roasted Garlic Alfredo and Pesto and the Pepita Parmesan was a fun texture twist. All of the perfect textures combine with the most amazing of flavors so good you’ll become pressed to want to think about things any other way. The sandwich was on the softest of ciabatta’s combined again with some of the heavenly mozzarella and pesto again to make a sandwich so good that you’ll wish you can forget chicken Parmesan, and enjoy this instead.

When it came down to dessert it was a truly tough choice but ultimately we decided on the PB Candy Bar Cheesecake slice. This has become my new favorite dessert from the first time I had it and it’s worth every decadent, delicious and  Bestie was so happy with this choice! The Peanut Butter and chocolate will lose you in their world of how desserts should be. Just enough sweet to balance the chocolate and with the lightest whipped coconut cream you’ve ever had.

Overall we can’t wait to come back for another experience, the food was amazing and the experience was sublime. Madeline our server, was an absolute doll and gave great recommendations and made an overall great experience so much better. This place has cemented as one of my favorite Vegan go to restaurants"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNzZiRm5nRRAB,Excellent vegan food. The nachos were the best. Great service as well.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScUx5Y29nRRAB,"I came to Omaha for a work conference and looked for a vegan spot. I got the buffalo cauliflower, fried chicken and mashed potatoes and a peanut butter and chocolate milkshake. It was DELECIOUS!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyOVBuSmNBEAE,The service was amazing! She recommended the lychee black tea and it was delicious! But I did come in and ask if I could get light oil with my tofu scramble (a lot of oil makes me sick) and I feel like there was way twice as much oil.

Top service from Hailie."

With our appetizer  (a hair in the food) our waitress was appalled 😱 and quickly apologized took the food back and brought us a new Appetizer  asap!

They waitress was not good and rude, she literally threw the checks in the table after we asked to split (even though we had asked to split when ordering the check and she brought a single check), had to ask twice for the dessert menu which was also left with an attitude and when asked for a box to pack leftovers she brought a box that clearly didn’t fit them and got visibly annoyed when we asked for a bigger one."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURobDRxVmtnRRAB,"Not what it used to be. Chick pea bacon is ALWAYS burnt to a crisp. Burgers and sandwiches are dry as with the bread. The menu has lost both its diverseness and origality, and would opt for food with carbs, that are easy (Ie sandwiches, deep fry, pastas and salads Basically the entire menu with some variations). Menu never changes anymore. Often times they don't come up with new specials and just use old ideas. Modern Love used to be very quality, vegan, and almost homecooked. Now it's basically streamlined, and over priced vegan fast food. Despite being vegan the Restaurant itself isn't very reduce, reuse and recycle. Some of the staff are the snootiest and most stuck up people I've ever met, and some are the loveliest people. It is mostly the former unfortunately.

I'm not sure what changed. It went from arguably being one of the best vegan restaurants in the country to becoming low on the list. Used to be my number one vegan spot in the country. Now I avoid it. Whole foods currently is the best vegan spot in Omaha and that's terrible.

They took the COVID pandemic very seriously and still somewhat care to a degree so that does deserve props."

I had the meatloaf and my girlfriend had the crispy chicken sandwich. Both were amazing! I strongly recommend garlic parmesan Brussels sprout as an appetizer, but watch out, you’re gonna wanna eat the whole thing. We will definitely be back the next time we’re in the area!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoOVlDNnJnRRAB,"I brought my fiancé there for a late valentines dinner. We were both excited to try the food as we’ve read great things. The waitress and other staff seemed nice. Our order was completely wrong and only one of the two entrees were brought out to us. She stated she was confused?? We went over what we wanted with her and substituted one ingredient AND she wrote it down. So while waiting for my partners food to be made, since the waitress was confused and didn’t put the order in, my food got cold. The to go containers had debris in them which is probably because they keep the to go containers at the bottom of a stand facing up instead of down. She saw it has she was handing them to us then apologized and gave us new containers. Good food, but the experience was bad."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNWJ5YUt3EAE,"Wait staff took order, got confused, and did not make half the order. Food ok, service below average."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNFpHSmNnEAE,"Hip vegan restaurant - on point. What's not to love!
Meat loaf entree was delicious. Chocolate milkshake was just right. Not overly sugary.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNocU9UUkhREAE,"Because I am not from Nebraska ,I will say that it's rare to find a  all vegan restaurant here. The food I got was decent but there is some serious competition out there so I didn't know how to rate this place. I spent $40 to try several options. A cookie,  philly and fries and Mac and cheese.  The philly was interesting . It wasn't gross nor great. The cookie? It was a cookie.  Not a $4 cookie. Believe it or not, cookies can lack flavor.. This needed more.. Mac and cheese scared me because it looked dry but after I mixed it up for a taste...it started smacking.  Kinda tasted like hamburger helper without the meat. It was good. Everyone has a different palate. I can't say it's too pricey because vegan is pricey.  Would I eat here again if I passed through Nebraska? No. Maybe try something other than the philly or the cookie.  Try the Mac and cheese."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNE8yZlFnEAE,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCLTVMSWNBEAE,This was my first time experiencing vegan food. I had a burger because I didn't want to go too far out of my comfort zone. It was truly amazing. Flavorful and built beautifully.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCcV92Uy1RRRAB,"This was my first time eating here after my sister recommended this place. The spinach and artichoke dip was amazing although the pita bread tasted like a charred hamburger bun, the flavor of the dip was spot on and still tasted cheesy. I had the crispy tofu sandwich and it was less than spectacular. The tofu was flavorless, I would describe the taste as similar to a wet napkin. Which was disappointing because the artichoke dip and drink got my hopes up. But I was left disappointed in this tasteless sandwich."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCZ2UyVHBRRRAB,"They are cooking up some serious magic in this vegan kitchen! First timer here and it was AMAZING! I would probably not order the 'meatloaf' again, but that is mostly due to personal texture preference. It was seriously the only thing we could tell that wasn't actual meat. Brussels were on point. Mac and cheese with fried chicken was 💣.  Chicken and mushroom gravy was also very crunchy and tasted great! I am not vegan and will be back!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCLXE2dzhnRRAB,"This place is hit or miss and lately it has become more of a miss which pains me to write this as we used to be big fans.

The ambience is nice, service was slow but acceptable and the food used to be great.
We have been there 3 times in the past few months and we decided not to come back anymore.

The food has become extremely salty to the point of barely being edible. We thought initially was one dish but others were the say. The service is just terribly slow and with wrong orders and missing items."

I whole heartedly recommend this place, but I have complaint that might seem odd. Their portion sizes are much too large. They’d increase their profits and honestly improve the dining experience if they toned them down by 20% or so. Our table was so overwhelmed by the two appetizer plates that two of us didn’t order entrees, and neither of two that we’re ordered ended up anywhere close to half finished. Some might say, “yay leftovers!”, but I found it excessive and wasteful. Regardless, it’s good food and worth the visit."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCZzhDeXBRRRAB,"As an omnivore myself, I can say that Modern Love was a solid experience. The appetizer -  fried cashew mozzarella - was a unique (and good!) experience. The cashew cheddar mac and cheese with buffalo seitan was also enjoyable and a good portion size. While a bit more expensive due to the ingredients used, still a worthwhile experience overall."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtOHQyelF3EAE,Food was gross and greasy.  Made us sick. What a waste of time and money.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtc1pYMlFBEAE,This place has delicious vegan options that taste even better then their original recipes with made meat. Highly recommend the shrooms and grits. The atmosphere is lacking a little bit but you can beat the food.

There are so many yummy options on the menu that it’s hard to decide what to get! I ordered the cauliflower honee garlic wings and the mushroom fried chick’n which came with mashed potatoes, mushroom gravy, and coleslaw. WOW! Incredible! The texture of the mushroom chick’n was unbelievable and the coating was so crispy!!! The mashed potatoes and gravy to die for. I loved everything I got.

Not only will they refuse service to the unvaccinated second class citizens, they have their staff “patrolling” the restaurant to catch anyone breaking any of the CDC guidelines. If you want to experience what it was like in Germany during the 1940s, I’d recommend eating here! Otherwise, take your business to a place that supports individual choice."

So we ordered takeout including the honey cauliflower wings online and it said on the website “EXTRA ranch, $2.00.” Implied in that is that it comes with ranch. So when we didn’t get it, we went back to get some and offered to pay of course. But my partner also just politely mentioned the website and how it was confusing, suggesting a change. The girl looked at her with daggers and disdain, said nothing and was surly about the whole thing. And they charged us $2.19 for the ranch after a $50 order plus tip. Unbelievable. Probably won’t go back. Not worth terrible treatment for decent food."

The chimichanga Mexican style entree was remarkable with interesting textures and flavors.  The kale salad was delicious as usual. However, I had to sit by the cold window with no shades to block out the glare of car headlights. I think the layout was too open.  I think a cozier atmosphere similar to Jams or J.

I wish they had more gluten free options that were nut/oat free (allergy restrictions) but their staff is also super friendly and love the atmosphere
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHbzh1ZnlBRRAB,What Can I say come check it out
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHbzdEWjNRRRAB,Modern Love is amazing! We have gone multiple times now whenever we are in the Omaha area and they never disappoint :) Their staff are always so friendly and you can hear them having a great time and laughing together in the kitchen.

My entree was the Mushroom Fried Chick'n, and the table ordered the Nachos Molo.  Both of these dishes were unbelievable.  The flavors exploded in your mouth.  The ""mouth feel"" of the food was also perfect, not soft or undercooked.  The Mushroom Fried Chick'n was as close to Southern Fried as I have ever had in a restaurant (and my South Carolina raised wife makes the most amazing fried chicken; this was a close 2nd).
The staff were incredibly helpful and knowledgeable of the available items. They took time to tell us their personal preferences from the menu and were able to offer perfect suggestions.
The ambiance of the restaurant is perfect.  The music is not too loud or obtrusive to the dinner conversation.  Drinks were kept filled and the Staff were very attentive, but not intrusive.
This was my first visit, and most likely my once in a lifetime opportunity to eat here and I was not disappointed.
I would encourage you all, vegan or not, to stop here and enjoy a meal that is one in a million.
Thank you Isa Moskowitz for creating such an amazing place and unspeakably good food.  You deserve all 5 stars!"

Unfortunately I wasn’t able to make it back to the restaurant, so I called and spoke to the restaurant and was told on Tuesday that my account would be refunded for the mishap. Today is Sunday and I had to call the store again to inquire about my refund. I am disappointed, I didn’t receive my food and I had to call the store at least three times, throughout the week, to inquire about my refund, (I wouldn’t have had to do if my food wasn’t given to the wrong customer)."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHZ3Z2ODR3RRAB,"Excellent food and dining experience.  We went with a party of 6 people and everyone thoroughly enjoyed their orders.  I loved the Hibiscus Kombucha with the cinnamon stick,  very refreshing!  I'm excited to see a thriving, vegan restaurant with delicious food.  10/10 would recommend."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHME52ZjN3RRAB,This is one of my favorite restaurants. I have totally order two shakes and drank the both before I got home. The Chik’n fried oyster mushrooms are so so good. I haven’t not liked an item on the menu and everything I’ve had here is fantastic. Definitely gon Even if you’re not vegan you will enjoy it.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHd05tX0ZBEAE,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHd055WVZ3EAE,"Fantastic, best vegan cheese I've ever had. Staff was friendly, food was delicious, atmosphere relaxed and pleasant!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHd01pZ09BEAE,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHZ1BYZ1hBEAE,"The food was amazing and I will be returning very soon! I do not get into the vegan food as much as my friend but when she took me here last night, I was extremely happy and satisfied with everything, from customer service dealing with Aliyah when I got there to every food item I tried (we ordered over $60 worth of food for 2 of us) and it was worth every single dollar we spent. I cannot begin to explain all the goodness in this food. Everything tasted as if you were really eating ""meat"", which I do but the substitutes and ingredients used were 100% on point. I recommend this place and I will be returning....soon! Fire Vegan Food yall tap in"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2aF9YYXFRRRAB,"This place surprised us in so many ways. Due to some unforeseen circumstances i had to try vegetarian food one day and having read rave reviews about this establishment we went ahead and tried it. Not a single dish was uninspiring. Everything we ordered, from the tofu burgers to the chickpea gyros(they call it hero for some reason) and the cashew paste mac and cheese, was a perfect blend of taste, texture and flavours. The decor is urban chic and the seating is sufficiently socially distanced. Our party of 6 was mighty impressed by the food we got. They really are on top of their vegan game here"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2NjRlS3FnRRAB,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2NjhiSHFnRRAB,Great restaurant ... love the service quality
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2cTlLTlhREAE,My first vegan experience.  Loved  it.  A must visit in Omaha.

Even my non veg husband was completely satisfied and ordered stuff to take with us for the next day!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2bVlMRjFBRRAB,Had a mushroom salad which was good.  Tried the tofu and cheese steak and didn't care for it.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2eHY3Qm13RRAB,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2eHFiYlZREAE,"I had the BEST first experience at Modern Love for lunch today!

The 𝗖𝗵𝗶𝗰𝗸𝗽𝗲𝗮 𝗣𝗮𝗿𝗺𝗲𝘀𝗮𝗻 𝗛𝗲𝗿𝗼 might just be the best “chicken” parmesan sandwich I’ve ever had!!! I’m not kidding. The chickpea patty was so crispy and flavorful and the “mozzarella” was so creamy, melty, and delicious… I can’t even describe how mesmerized I was with it. Definitely the BEST thing we ordered!!!

My second favorite thing we ordered had to be the 𝗚𝗮𝗿𝗹𝗶𝗰 𝗣𝗮𝗿𝗺𝗲𝘀𝗮𝗻 𝗕𝗿𝘂𝘀𝘀𝗲𝗹𝘀. Again… NOT REAL PARMESAN?! HOW?! It was the creamiest, most delicious garlicky “cheese” sauce, and it perfect complimented the Brussel sprouts. As someone who puts grated Parmesan on her veggies almost every night, I’M SHOCKED I couldn’t taste a difference. I would drink that sauce with a straw.

We also ordered the 𝗡𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗼 𝗠𝗮𝗰 & 𝗦𝗵𝗿𝗲𝘄 which had cashew cheddar mac sauce, walnut chorizo, pico, avocado, pickled jalapeños, and cilantro. Again the “cheese” was unbelievable. And the walnut “chorizo” tasted JUST like the real thing. I really want to try the classic mac next time!

We also got a 𝗞𝗮𝗹𝗲 𝗖𝗮𝗲𝘀𝗮𝗿 𝗦𝗮𝗹𝗮𝗱 that was one of the most beautiful plated salads I’ve ever been served. Peep the mini salt and pepper shakers in that pic. So cute!

Our server was so on top of it and incredibly helpful with suggestions for our first time. I seriously can’t rave enough about Modern Love. Yet another local establishment I wish I had tried sooner! And the place was HOPPING at peak lunch time which made me so happy to see.

If you haven’t already, go check them out and be equally mesmerized in how they trick your tastebuds. I’m going to start working my way through the rest of their sandwiches."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2aXYzcG5BRRAB,Ok so I've never ate vegetarian or vegan. And I realized it's not really my cup of tea. But the fries and the ketchup🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2c0tQWGNBEAE,"Wide selection, friendly staff, quick service.  For us meat lovers, I can't even tell I'm eating healthy!  Ha."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2bjRLTk5BEAE,Very unique but very good
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2al8zX2J3EAE,Love the food!! Mac and cheese with the Buffalo cauliflower is my fav but my bf loves the chicken parmesan sandwich. The salads are always great no matter what. I've never been inside to dine but plan to soon
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2cDVhRXFnRRAB,Great food! All of the dishes are well thought out and packed with flavor. I've never been disappointed with anything I've tried. Highly recommend.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2bTlLa2NnEAE,Neat atmosphere and delicious vegan food! Definitely a must-visit when we visit Omaha
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNJMWFHdFR3EAE,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2OWZlbEV3EAE,"I would have given this place 5 stars if there wasn’t so much MSG in the food. The fried mozzarella tastes like real cheese mozzarella! The Chick’n bacon ranch is very tasty and the fries are out of this world! Everything was delicious and we didn’t consider what it took to make Vegan food taste like the best of non-Vegan food. We should have known better being Vegan for several years in the past. About 15 minutes after we left, we got the typical MSG dry, swollen tongue and tight throat sensation. We don’t dine out a lot and avoid MSG whenever possible, so we are pretty sensitive to it. This reaction was one of the worst MSG reactions we have ever had, which means the food we ate here contained large amounts of MSG. Sadly, we won’t be going back and do not recommend this establishment only because of the overload of MSG. If MSG doesn’t bother you, then give it a try. Wait staff is friendly and prompt. Atmosphere is relaxing."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2bnRqV1lBEAE,"Pricey but good. While they do have gluten-free options, you need to be extremely careful when ordering here as the staff aren't always hyper-vigilant about your needs. I had to return food to the kitchen so they could remake it gluten-free after putting the fried tofu (cross contact) on the dish and the staff was sure it was okay."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2Z3B2WGp3RRAB,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2eE95ZkJ3EAE,"A really cool spot, also a great place to try new cuisine!"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVeVlxN093EAE,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhal9Ec0t3EAE,This restaurant is really cute! I had Brussels sprouts and the goddess bowl. Servers were all extremely friendly. Many of the dishes looked like “indulgent vegan food” but my bowl was low oil and fresh. If you’re a WFPB person you might only have a couple menu options. Staff was very friendly too.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhcmU3a2R3EAE,"One of my favorite restaurants ever. It's amazing what vegans can do with cashews. The food is wonderful and the portions copious.

The staff was friendly and helpful and easily accommodated my multiple dietary requirements. The only problem is that I couldn't eat more in a setting. Indeed, I ate far too much."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhLWJXZlVREAE,It was yum
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhdnJxbXBBRRAB,First visit and not disappointed! Ordered the roasted garlic alfredo and a peanut butter sundae for dessert. Restaurant has a welcoming vibe and will comp your parking. Will definitely return.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURheXRQRWhBRRAB,My boyfriend and i have gone here a couple times and usually it is pretty great but today we went and it was absolutely disgusting food. I ordered the chicken bacon ranch and he ordered the italian sub. Both sandwich's were so bad we took two bites each and had to throw them away. waste of money. However the staff is friendly and sweet. the fries and ranch we had were fantastic.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURha3N2STFBRRAB,Amazing! Love that everything is vegan.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhNHNhaVVnEAE,Delicious! Best place in Omaha for vegetarian/vegan food!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhZ3ByTUlREAE,Great place with great food! A must visit place especially for vegans.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhX09QekxREAE,"The food was all spot on, the ice cream was impressive and our server, Moriah was awesome. The decor wasn't really my vibe and made me weary at first but definitely worth the visit!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhbE1DbW1nRRAB,"GREAT FOOD, absolutely horrible service. They made the bartender our original waiter, and then he forgot about us. We had to call another waiter over to bring water and to take our appetizer order after 30 mins of being there. Our water wasn’t refilled until an hour later when we asked again. It took an hour and half to get our entrees out and another 45 mins for a single shake. We had 4 different waiters, only one visited twice after my mom finally said something. I was there for my birthday 🤦‍♀️

Hopefully this was an off day. I’ll try it again because the food was amazing but if I get this experience again I’ll never recommend it to anyone in the future."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhMExUQ1p3EAE,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhd09xeExBEAE,Great. Can't wait to return
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhdThIZHN3RRAB,The friendliest staff I’ve ever encountered. Amazing experience. My comrade that I ate with even forgot his phone and they are willing to mail it to his house for him cuz we are on a oneway road trip back “home”. 50 stars out of 5. Thank you.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhNi0zbXdRRRAB,

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhazlXRHFnRRAB,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhX2QzdEJBEAE,"You wouldn't expect a phenomenal vegan restaurant to exist in Nebraska, but here it is.

We ordered the Alfredo pasta and pepper jack steak sandwich. I'm not a real food critic, but both were substantial meals and absolutely delicious.

The steak sandwich came with potato salad, which I haven't had for years, and it was everything I remembered it was but without any guilt. It had a good amount of spice to it. Not overwhelming even for my wife who is averse to spicy food. The seitan was well seasoned, and much better than Ive had at other restaurants.

The Alfredo I've had before when they were only doing curbside pickup, and I must say it was a step above to eat it in person. The garlic bread it came with was phenomenal, and the greens on the side complimented it well enough.

Service was great and prompt. We had just come from a hike and our water glasses were always kept full.

Atmosphere was also pleasant, besides the guy we could overhear trying to debunk veganism to his date, lol. He seemed to love his food too though.

Overall a great place, we plan on making the trip back from Lincoln whenever we have an excuse to do so."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhN2RIUFJ3EAE,Great food and ice cream.  Enjoyed my meal
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhN2RLU09BEAE,They took away the only thing I came here for:the bucket of wings. They make me wear a mask in my own vehicle like it’s their property. One thing to have things a certain way in your own property but don’t intrude on mine
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhOWV5UE9BEAE,So good! Had the nachos with the chimichanga and my wife got the Buffalo Mac and cheese. Can’t go wrong with anything you get here!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhdGFudFNREAE,"Modern Love was even better than I imagined it to be. I've been vegan for over 13 years, and this was by far my favorite meal I've had at a restaurant. The staff was so very friendly and the food came to us beautifully plated and in a short amount of time. I highly recommend the buffalo cauliflower mac and cheese."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNbDZUTkVREAE,"I’m not vegan, but this place makes me want to be! So cool to see alternatives for literally everything…I love it! Modern cheeseburger is always my go-to, but this time I added the Buffalo Cauliflower Mac & Shews. Boy I’m glad I did! Everything was spectacular as always, and every time I leave, I’m already thinking of when to come back! The fried mozzarella appetizer is legitimately my favorite dish as well. I brought leftovers to my fiancé who is also not vegan, he loved it too."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhMktPdHpRRRAB,"OMG the BEST vegan food ever!! The fried cheese just melts in the mouth, the steak and pepper jack was AMAZING. Food was so delicious, I bought the cookbook!
The restaurant was very easy to find, with convenient parking nearby. Restaurant was SUPER CUTE and comfortable. Menu is 100% vegan. Table and restrooms were clean. Wait staff was sweet and very knowledgeable. Sorry I didn't catch her name.
Overall I would return to Omaha just to eat at Modern Love again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxel9EcGFBEAE,"Came here for the first time during covid protocols to get takeout. Only ever got the buffalo wing bucket and it was amazing! Recently they opened there dine in area and it looks stunning! Not to mention that there chickpea parmesan hero, and there alfredo pesto were absolutely to die for! Amazing restaurant! The only issue we had was that the servers were having quite a time getting to our table in a timely manner, but that can be attributed to a completely booked evening. So great job!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxaDlPSlVREAE,"Food was tasty! I am not vegan, but the food here is delicious, the cocktails are good, and the service is excellent."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxdFpHSmJnEAE,"This restaurant has it all. Perfectly crafted drinks (I only drank non-alcoholic ones), delicious food, decor and ambiance, and every meal was presented with such attention to detail. I tried a lot in my two days in Omaha: the chocolate milkshake, strawberry ice cream, blueberry cheesecake, butterfly lemonade, watermelon seltzer, classic mac n shew bowl, chik’n bacon ranch, and an Italian salad. Yes, I did. Everything was immaculate. I especially like the fried chik’n. They must have love in the batter? Bc I haven’t had a fried chik’n like that in my three years of veganism. I also really appreciate that it is made from tofu! Not the overly processed soy substitutes. Perfection. Modern Love receives an 11/10 from me."
ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxbGJ3XxAB,The food or the drinks does not disappoint!  Everything was yummy. I am glad the dining room has reopened. The team members are very friendly and know how to work as a team!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxOGN5Nnh3RRAB,"Best vegan food I’ve had in a long time. Chickpea parm sandwich had so much flavor! Buffalo seitan wings were also delish, super spicy! For dessert I had the raspberry cheesecake, BOMB!! My to go order was missing the sandwich and thankfully i noticed before getting too far but still earns 5 stars because the food is beyond amazing!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxc1pXM093EAE,Great staff and great food. Was an awesome stop for a vegan traveler
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxMGRUQlB3EAE,"I've been vegan for five years and Modern Love has been my favorite vegan spot for three of those years. I absolutely love it. It's worth the three-four hour drive for me. The food is incredible and I hope to someday have everything on the menu.

This time around, I had the eggplant parmesan, mozzarella balls, and a strawberry shake. It was absolutely the best vegan meal I've had for as long as I can remember. I'm almost definitely going to drive up there again soon, if only for this amazing food.

Absolutely recommend it. No matter how far out of your way it might be, go to Modern Love!"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxNVBTSzlRRRAB,Still no dine in and masks are required to go in as of 6-26-2021. I probably should have called before showing up to check status.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxbVBLRGtnRRAB,This is my favorite vegan restaurant in the USA besides Vedge in Philadelphia. Everything made from scratch and delicious. We’re from Atlanta but make sure to visit every time we’re in town! BLT Mac on point! And you best try those cauliflower wings.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxbVBLOTd3RRAB,Very creative menu with many delicious options for everyone. The food is always well seasoned and delicious. Would highly recommend!!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxME9qYnNBRRAB,"Stopped by here on my way to a long road trip. Picked up about 2days worth of food. Had the fried tofu salad, cauliflower bites, the breaded tofu sandwich, garlic parmesan brussel sprouts and egg plant parmesan. All amazing. Ive been to many vegan places in Los Angeles and Las Vegas and everything here was delicious and fresh. Thank you for your wonderful service. Oh and the rose lemonade is so good! Will be back. Forgot to take pics of the food but it looked just like the pictures."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxa0lubll3EAE,"When calling my to go order in I let the girl on the phone know that I would be in at noon for my pick up order and I would pay cash. When I arrived, she let me know that she would have the cook start my order. Yes, I was a few minutes late, but NO ONE on the phone stated that I had to pay before my order would even be started!!! Super disappointing since I only have 30 minutes for lunch and was excited to finally try Modern Love."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxa2ZlZGZnEAE,"NACHOS NACHOS NAHCOS. Curious what walnut chorizo is? WONDER NO MORE. Y’all, these nachos are the BEST. Prior to coming here I thought I had found the best vegan nachos- I. WAS. WRONG. These nachos are hands down the best I’ve ever had- as both a vegan and non vegan. The cheese, the pickled toppings, the guac, the walrizo (work in progress)! If you ever find yourself in Omaha go here. And if you don’t have any upcoming trips to Omaha- make one. Worth the travels.
Also the fried mozz balls are drool worthy. Ok I’m done.
Go here."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxZ2ZyTGZBEAE,Aliyah Very rude over the phone when I called to see if my order was ready for pick up.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxX29xbldBEAE,I typically go here once a week and love it but my most recent experience here was horrible. Alleha (the front store manager) was extremely rude and had terrible costumer service skills. On top of that the order was made wrong. The employees never say the same thing about allergen specific questions which is not expectable when ordering a meal.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnckxPZUZ3EAE,Great vegan food!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxM3REMm5BRRAB,"I just ordered the Almond Joy Brownie and Raspberry Cheesecake. My friend and I loved both of these desserts.

We have tried almost all the menu items at this point and everything is amazing. We’ve brought so many “skeptic meat eaters here” and they’ve been wowed as well!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLX3FMWDhBRRAB,"Today was my moment of truth.. I have been teetering on going vegan for quite some time for both ethical and health reasons. Today was my first order at ML and I will SOOOOO be back. I didn't know vegan food could possibly taste THIS good. I love veggies so I was hopeful, but there's so much flavor! I'm even more excited to be on this journey now.. You guys should hold cooking classes (hint hint ;)) Thank you again!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJa2FtZmFREAE,"Overpriced as all hell, fries were burnt, and the individual that answered the phone was super unprofessional, to the point where we thought we called the wrong number.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVemJtdHdRRRAB,"Great food. A restaurant like this is sorely needed. Only drawback is that the hightop tables are too small! Everything on it is too crowded and I feel like something’s going to fall off.

////////
Update Apr. 2021 — I really wish there was a section on the website of *just* the menu. I don’t want to have to download door dash, log in and almost place an order all just to see what’s on the dang menu. Photos of menus on Google aren’t always up to date."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLX282ZGdBRRAB,This vegan food is meant to taste like the real thing and it is great. If a vegan place can make it in NYC you know it's good. The nachos are some of the best I've had- the amount of flavor packed in. Any pasta dish is always great. I was surprised at how much I liked the mozzarella balls. The one thing I wouldn't recommend- burgers. With all of the vegan ones in the market now there are plenty of better things on the menu (like the chicken parm fabulous)
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLcG9IZkN3EAE,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLLW9mZVBBEAE,Mozzarella sticks were yummy and filling. The cheeseburger and philly lacked spice and flavor. When returned home fries were already soggy after a 20 minute drive home. I may give another shot.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLdXZQMXVRRRAB,Best food in Omaha
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLNnF6Wk5nEAE,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLcE1iZ0RnEAE,They were super friendly & helpful with my diet & the food was amazing!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLNFB6NUxnEAE,"This is my favorite place in Omaha. You could take the Pepsi challenge of comparing any of their entrees with a non vegan restaurant around here and this place would still come out on top.

The menu is naughty. Nachos. Mac. Wings. Burgers. But then they also show their sophisticated side (It's always changing).

Your date could order a green goddess bowl, trying to not pig out because it's your first time out, but then you get curious and say ""poutine burger? This has to be tried. I need to live my best life now"".

She looks at your magnificent burger with envy. You politely ask ""would you like a taste?"" (To get her to stop staring). She takes the most massive bite you've ever seen, easily taking out half of your plate's real estate. Distraught, confused, yet intrigued, you only agree to another date because she concedes the last seitan wing to you (the wings are phenomenal, and you can order them in buckets.)

Years later you are married to this person. You named your kids after the members of the Wu Tang clan. Little Method man always asks to come back to modern love because he wants some of that mac and cheese. You've won the game of life because you decided to check out this vegan restaurant.

Their Desserts are pretty good too. Big fan of the cheesecake"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5dDRDS0FREAE,"Twice have made weekend trips to Omaha just to eat at Modern Love. Food, cocktails and desserts are amazing."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5MTl5Ml9RRRAB,"No eat in options. Had to call ahead. The pandemic is on the way out, time to open up."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5MWNDNDRBRRAB,"They've done an amazing job keeping everyone safe over the last year. Their curbside takeout has been well run and the food continues to be outstanding. I look forward to returning for in-person dining, but not until restaurant employees are all able to get vaccinated (they weren't in a priority group in Nebraska like other states) along with the general public."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5bGN2V1JBEAE,"Initially went for the homemade vegan poptarts; since then I've been hooked on all there food. If you're looking for vegan food on the fly, give it a shot."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5eGQyT2NnEAE,Good food but come on...open up your dining room already. Seriously.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5Z2QtR05nEAE,"I need to come back to Omaha just so I can eat my way through more of their menu.

The oatmeal cream pie is definitely worth it for dessert."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5a0p5dHRBRRAB,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5Z0xiSVF3EAE,I ordered after I called ahead and they said they would be open until 8 pm. They charged me and then a hour later they said they were going to close early. So they would have to refund me my money. Still waiting for my refund.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5MS1mNXlRRRAB,"Waited for 40 minutes for my door dash order pickup. I called the number about 8 times and got no response. I also waited outside for a bit trying to get somebodies attention. I understand there were power outages today, but there was no communication from the restaurant, which negatively affects my job status on the door dash side. I also wonder if other folks’ orders were ignored today. Disappointed :/"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5bThXZE1REAE,"Visiting from Chicago
I’ve had a lot of vegan food and this place was outstanding from the Pattie Melt to the dessert!!!
A must try!!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5bTZudy1BRRAB,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5dzRfMkhnEAE,"Daaammmmm! This was amazing!!! Got a smorgasbord. Buffalo Seitan Mac. You know the Mac is good if there’s a whole section for Mac and cheese. Nachos molo. I prefer fresh jalapeños but still amazing I’m sure they would do it if I asked for it. Kale Ceaser salad. Perfect fresh and crunchy. Went through the curbside pick up and whoever helped us was so nice! 10/10 stopped by on a road trip and wish this was in denver, Co. Think about it, y’all! Would add photos but it’s literally gone."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5a2NfWnFRRRAB,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5cHJQWnJBRRAB,"Good COVID practices- easy to use online ordering, curbside pickup, food packaged well- just had to zap mine a couple minutes.

I got the Mac and shews, with the cornbread tofu and grilled mushroom, and a brownie. I don't remember what me wife got.

I'm not vegan, and only a beginner sorta semi-vegetarian who loves steak, but this was delicious! The cashew cheese was very satisfying, and the grilled mushroom and tofu added a nice meat-like element. Everything was well made and just delicious.

My wife loved her meal as well, and three brownies, though maybe a little more fidgeting than is my preference, were great, too.

Only ding? It's a little expensive. But it was dang good mac and almost cheese!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5a29uVVpBEAE,"Big fan of MoLo. I wish you had the meatloaf more often, because it’s truly off the charts amazing. The Mac & Shews never disappoints, and the burgers are meals in themselves. And the desserts? One of everything, please. So happy you’re in Omaha! ❤️"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5bklycENBEAE,Came here last year around March while coming through Omaha. Had extremely poor service. Came back tonight to give it another try- staff seems to be just as rude. Food is not bad.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5NE82bzdBRRAB,Modern love knocked it out of the park with their New Years Eve dinner for two
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTcDRUQ2pnRRAB,They have always been great but their response to Covid is outstanding. The commitment they have made to take out shows and I love getting food from there. Every special occasion during Covid has had Modern Love as the food choice.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTLTZMU0hREAE,"Hands down one of the best vegan spots I have ever been too! I was driving thru Omaha on a road trip and stopped here for dinner and was absolutely BLOWN WAY! Their buffalo cauliflower wings are easily the best I have ever had! I was seriously contemplating turning around and driving back just to order more because it was one of the best flavors to ever grace my taste buds. I got their Channa masala for my entree, and it was also super tasty! Their portions are huge which if you have a hollow leg like I do then this is the right spot for you. Needless to say I am sad they don’t have one of these where I live and will no doubt be stopping here every trip through Nebraska I take!"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpa05uV1B3EAE,Incredible food. We are always nervous to try something new on the menu because we don’t think it could be as good as what we got last time... yet it is always incredible! We’re committed to trying everything on the menu. This is our go to place for visiting family and friends 6/5 stars
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpa0liOWNREAE,Always great vegan food 😋
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpN2Q2YkNREAE,"As someone who does enjoy meat, I'll eat the hell out of the seitan wings here and feel satiated and not miss the meat.
In addition to a great menu for all palates, they also carry great wine, and do contactless/curbside pickup.
🤙❤"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpOWEtYnFnRRAB,I called to place an order over the phone as I normally do. The person who answered the phone was huffing and puffing and hat a tone in her voice as if it was an inconvenience for her to pick up the phone. When I told her I would like to place an order she told me to go online to order as a convenience. I let her know that I always call over the phone and no one has ever had an issue because I order one item. When I told her what I wanted to order which was simple it was macaroni she responded telling me to be more specific because there’s different versions. There’s really not. I let her know that I wanted to speak to someone else and she said that she’s the only one working today and I let her know that her voice and her attitude is really reflecting that. One of the reasons I like modern love is because of the experience. So don’t have someone working for you that finds it as an inconvenience to do something as simple as picking up the phone and greeting somebody with respect.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpcGRHQnRnRRAB,The best vegan Mac n cheez I’ve ever tried and I’ve had a lot. Topped it with mushroom bacon. SO GOOD! Kinda pricey but huge portions and really great food. Also tried their Green Goddess Bowl and Apple Cinnamon Pop Tart. Yum!! I recommend ordering thru their website instead of third party apps for cheaper prices :)
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpdVltaVV3EAE,"Funky after taste on the burger,"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpdkx6WlN3EAE,The most amazing vegan food you'll ever have.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDblpqdFJnEAE,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDaXZqWG5nRRAB,Simply amazing!! Everything we ordered  from appetizers to dessert was full of flavor and clearly made with love ❤️!!! If we lived in Omaha we would be there allll the time!!! The kale ceaser salad and the buffalo Mac and cheese were some of our favorites!!!  Don’t forget to grab a raspberry oat bar on your way out!! :)
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDb3N5UW1nRRAB,We adore Modern Love.  They have done the best job of any restaurant we frequent in ensuring safety during the pandemic. The service is always super and down to earth.  We had the cookie dough brownie and the peanut butter candy bar cheesecake tonight and they were fabulous.  Keep up the great work!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDZ3RlekFREAE,They have so many options that are vegan and gf friendly! Their Mac n cheese and cauliflower buffalo bites are fantastic!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDN0pEckt3EAE,My husband loved his bean burgers and steamed collard greens.  I could not have any as I am on no sodium diet.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDaklIVGVBEAE,"We’ve been fortunate to eat in vegan restaurants all over the world. My husband is certain that Modern Love is the best, based solely on the “calamari” (mushrooms). They were that good. Also good: Mac-N-Shews and the Modern burger. Portions are generous so we are too full to eat the desserts we bought but they will be great for breakfast. We are making sure to reroute our road trip to come home via Omaha in order to eat at Modern Love again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDakxhNTl3RRAB,"Phenomenal food! Due to the pandemic, we placed an order online, called on arrival and the staff set the food outside on a crate for us for safe, contactless handoff. They were super friendly and the food was absolutely delicious. We heard this was a must-visit vegan restaurant and since it was my first time in Nebraska, we made a point to come for dinner. The pumpkin cheesecake was amazing, as was the mac, tuna melt, and philly cheezsteak. The moz balls and the matcha mint milkshake were the stars of the show for sure though! Even non-vegan members of our group were impressed. It was hard to share. Will absolutely be back."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDbDUtcVRREAE,so tasty! very thought out dishes. 👏🏼
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDeDVISUJ3EAE,I eat here at least once a week and I think my body is starting to reject other foods
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDMjRxMlBBEAE,"This was AMAZING. I got the chicken (chick pea) parm and it was so so so good. Everyone was so nice, prices were great, and generous portions."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ4bVk2bFJ3EAE,"My partner and I are from NYC, so we've eaten at many dozens of top vegan restaurants over the years. Nonetheless, we both agreed that the fried mozzarella is the BEST thing we have ever tasted."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM4M2JLS1lnEAE,"I was just passing though Omaha, and after not eating well for the past few days (eating vegan on the road is tough!) I was pleasantly surprised by this restaraunt. Always great to get some vegan comfort food. If Modern Love ever opened a Minnesota location, I'd probably eat it every week. Or, maybe I should move to Omaha and eat here every day."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM4Z2FXa1R3EAE,"On my first visit, i had some kind of soup that was so sensuous, rich and decadent, my taste  buds could not stop doing the happy dance!  The main course was midwest traditional comfort food a la vegan..OMG!!!! If I could have fit more flavors in I would have.  You will love this food even if you aren't vegan.. The service is great, the atmosphere is warm and friendly...Eat here."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM4elBIT0N3EAE,"I have been to many vegan restaurants in many different cities, but none can measure up to Modern Love in Omaha. Their food is delicious, and in non-pandemic times, the atmosphere of the restaurant is chill and comforting. Since they started offering takeout, their packaging and menu items have adjusted well to the challenges of food to go. Additionally, all of their staff are friendly but well-practiced in social distancing and other precautions. They've got a good system.

They have something for everyone, from the foodie to the vegan to the carnivore, and everything in between. And even as a semi-regular customer (maybe twice a month), each time I order, I find something new and exciting, since their menu is simple yet rotates through new items each month. I haven't tried something I didn't find delicious.

Easily my favorite and go-to restaurant in Omaha, and quite possibly my favorite restaurant of all time. Would highly recommend."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURjejZPZXpBRRAB,Incredible food. Everything we ordered was amazing. Love the atmosphere and the staff are super friendly and nice. Great restaurant! Highly recommend!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURjb1ozeS1BRRAB,This place is amazing and under rated. Eating here has made me eat soo much less meat. Their wings are better than chicken wings!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURjNXVhRVJREAE,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURjcW8yOGhRRRAB,I am not going to lie I was super excited to eat here just to order today for the first time and my fries were soggy (like warmed up in a microwave warm 🙄) my hero sandwich was burnt and the cheese just slid right off which caused it to be messy and those wings....I had better overall rating 3/10 not impressed
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURjcW9XSDFBRRAB,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURjcXFHU0NREAE,The food is always good but the service is always slow.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURjMU5lcE1BEAE,"So freaking GOOD!!! And I'm not even vegan lol. Also, the curbside pickup menu has been clutch in terms of price."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURjMU9YUW5RRRAB,Yummy food. Specially cauliflower hot wings!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURjLU9YRFFREAE,Today was my first time trying this restaurant and I must say.....I am truly impressed. The classic cheese burger with mushroom bacon was outstanding!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURjdUl6bHdRRRAB,"Honestly I love this restaurant. So delicious, Nice 👍 people. But today was disappointing, I’m a single mom and so it’s super special when I get to treat my two boys with yummy food, our tradition is cheese Thursday, so we get vegan Mac and shews and nachos and that feeds all of us! Usually so good for the price you pay! But tonight, look I get it’s Covid but I paid 37$ for Mac and shews and nachos and the Mac and shews fed one of us tonight. They gave me half of the the side order usually is and I paid 14$ for the entree. I cried cuz I worked so hard to just get my kids discouraged. But that was it...  So I don’t I usually don’t write reviews and if I did I do it privately but... this isn’t cool no matter who you are. You should get what you pay for."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURjOE1hdndBRRAB,The food is awesome! The Mac n cheese is my fav!🥰
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURjd0xyX3pnRRAB,"Curbside. Order was supposed to be ready at 6:13.  They instruct you to call a specific number versus get out of your car. Called 27 times and got a busy recording. Finally got out of my car, parked illegally as all stalls were taken by other waiting curbside customers. Went to the door to try and get someone’s attention since their phones were obviously not working.  She rudely told me to step away from the door when it was so windy, I was trying to help get the door open a crack. But I get it. Told me she had no idea how long it would take and to go back to my car.  At 6:20, I called 5x and actually got through on the 5th try. She said they were running 30 minutes behind. It’s 7:10 and we’re still waiting. Called again for an estimated wait time. Guy was so rude. Told me I could leave and said there were still several orders ahead of us. This is my Mother’s Day.  Guess none of these young people care.

It’s now 7:27 and we are still waiting. After the rude man who said 30 minutes ago there were only 2 orders ahead of us, I called back and a ruder woman said there’s still 2 orders ahead now 35 more minutes later. We actually got her almost 1.5 hrs"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURjd0pxRFRnEAE,"I’ve been spending so much money here and there have been a few goofs but tonight is really upsetting. I ordered my food at 2:30 pm for a 5:30 pickup, didn’t get my food until 6:00 pm. I had a 5 min drive to my grandmother’s house and when I got here everything was cold. That’s the Mother’s Day dinner I got to serve my 94 yr old grandma and my mother."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjNzcyOTRRRRAB,"I have been going to this restaurant since before it was relocated to the downtown area.  The restaurant is owned by a chef that ensures that every meal tastes just as good as it looks. Every time I dine there, I am blown away by the presentation and quality of the ingredients. My personal favorite is their nachos with soyrizo, paired up with any of their smoothies.

Only reason why they fell short of five stars is because during my first experience, I waited close to half an hour to be served my meal, even though the two tables to our right arrived much later and were served first. I never experienced that again, thankfully."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvaF9IbEpBEAE,"What can I say, food is outstanding. Everything popped with flavor and it’s been a long time since I left a restaurant with my wife and we talked about how good the meal was the whole ride home. Honestly I only recently cut all meat and dairy out of my diet, but I can truly say that the Modern Burger is better than most beef burgers I’ve ever had. AMAZING!!

If I had to give it a grade out of 10, it would be 8.9. Only reason it wouldn’t be higher was because the fries were cold.

update - third time ordering take out during the pandemic and all three times waited 30 mins (up to 45 mins this last time) past when they said it would be ready for them to bring it out. I’m sorry but that’s unacceptable. Dropping from 5 stars to 2 stars just for misleading customers."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjMTZURGR3EAE,"I've been there twice and it's amazing! I had nachos, lasagna, a burger, and it was so good! We also had some vegan chicken nuggets. The box to take it home are biodegradable, which is very responsible!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjbC1XTGtBRRAB,"Beware of their covid 19 curbside drop  off process. It is horrible and very inefficient. Additionally the manger James should be ashamed of Himself .

They gave my food away to the wrong person. Then tried to blame me because they couldn’t figure out that they gave away my food.

when I called in to let them know that they made an error and gave the wrong person my food. James the manager accused my wife and I of stealing the food by sending someone there to “intercept our food” .

Can you imagine, you place an order to
Support a business, they screw up the order, they have your money, and then instead of trying to fix it they accuse you of theft.

What an embarrassing display of customer service and an utter lack of professionalism. I will never eat here again.

rude customer service . Accuses loyal customers of theft , when they make mistakes .  Would not recommend ."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjNThEZHl3RRAB,"I’ve only ever been here for take out as I only found out about it recently and dine in is closed for obvious reasons. I’m vegetarian and lactose intolerant and my assistant manager recommended this place because she’s vegan. As carry out goes Modern Love gets an A from me. The food has been top notch every time I’ve ordered and the shakes are very good! I just recently got one of the pop tarts and it was like a mini pie, definitely a must have! I would recommend this restaurant to anyone and everyone, meat eater or not."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjNjhxYnZ3RRAB,This review is based on my curb side order today. We ordered 2 crunch wraps. They were both cold and neither one had any crunch. I’m guessing they were made the day prior and were removed from the fridge and not heated. It was a big let down. I expect more from Modern Love (especially since we paid almost $40 with a tip). We have been loyal customers and were trying to support a local business during a difficult time...and you give us cold leftovers.  This is an insult and a slap in the face.  The food in the past has always been good.  My only complaint is that occasionally the temperature of the food is not satisfactory....especially considering it supposedly just came out of the kitchen.  We will not be returning for curbside pick up and I will have to give a lot of thought to returning at all.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzaGIta1lnEAE,Super impressed with this Omaha Gem! While I was in town I ate here twice and both experiences were great! Vegan Food at its finest!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzMmRIRGNBEAE,This place is delicious even for a carnivore like me. The food is amazing and they don't pretend that the food is meat they tell you exactly when each thing is made out of which I also appreciate. 😊

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzckxIdk5BEAE,Best food in Omaha!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzaFAtNVdREAE,"I have always loved Molo, but ever since the new place opened I feel like it has gone a bit downhill which is super disappointing. It took nearly an hour to get our main entrees, which is the longest it has ever taken there. Drinks were slow to come to the table, too. We then ordered dessert and 2 cups of black coffee, which then took another 20 minutes to arrive. The dessert was carrot cake which literally just needed to be plated and brought out. I try to be understanding that they’re busier now, but if you can’t deliver quality service then you need to look at expanding your staff or kitchen to provide that. This isn’t a cheap restaurant to eat at and not everyone wants to have a dinner take 1 hour and 45 mins."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzcjVQQjdBRRAB,"We got a reservation, not sure if you have to have them or if it's just really difficult to get a spot without one.

Got the fried mozzarella and nachos to start out with. Nachos were spicy and great. The mozzarella had a lot of flavor but I wasn't really feeling the texture of the cheese, it was a lot like warm cream cheese on the tongue.

We also tried the burgers, which again had a lot of flavor but the texture of the patties were... idk... sausage like? Real dense and chewy like that. I wasn't a fan but my friends thought they we're phenomenal so it could have just been me.

The homemade ginger ale was bomb! I'm giving them 4 stars because vegan food can be hard and everything had great flavor. Textures creeped me out though."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzcjhPa1lREAE,"My husband and I have been frequenting Modern Love for a few years. I have to say, our most recent visit just wasn’t up to par. Honestly, since they moved to their new location I haven’t been as happy with my food or service.
I’m sorry, because I adore this restaurant! Our service was mediocre last night, my food was cold, and I was actually kind of cold. My dessert was a delight, I had the cinnamon roll with ice cream and cherry compote. While it was delicious, it was served on a tiny plate making it a very messy dessert and difficult to eat.
I had the tempeh burger (no cheese) and fried for my side. My fries were cold, flavorless, and hard. My burger was also cold, and the bun was dry and flaking apart. I’ve ordered this meal dozens of times and it’s never been served this way. I miss the potato wedges that used to be served hot and full of flavor!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzbDcyMGJBEAE,"Went here for dinner with my wife tonight. I had only been to their previous tiny location so it was great to see the bigger space packed full! Even though it was busier than average for a Sunday, the staff was fantastic! The food was perfect, the menu was reasonably priced, and every staff member was friendly. They even send you off with a little gift :) If you haven't been, what are you waiting for?"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzbDdtR0lBEAE,"My boyfriend and his friend went here today, they went here because of the menu, his friends don’t eat meat. Some of his friends ordered  drinks. Some didn’t. They closed their tab, but then changed their minds and wanted to order drinks. The waitress then told them, “no, you can’t order drinks once you’re tab is closed”. So they were confused at first, she then proceeded to tell them that they were being rude and loud. They were in shock, but they left quietly. I’ve been wanting to try this place. But from what I read on the reviews and How Shocked I am. That my friends were treated this way. I’m good, the name of the restaurant is (modern love) that’s not love at all."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzNmFiSlpBEAE,"Incredible experience! Great tasting tea and coffee (from a local coffee shop). All of their food is amazing and it is all vegan. My friends who are not vegan or vegetarian still absolutely love the food and love going here. I ordered their Chana Masala With Brussels Sprouts and added the tumeric grilled tofu. It was definitely enough for 2 servings, but it was so good that I could not stop eating to save leftovers. The best chana masala I have had. Pretty swanky vibe but not crazy expensive and can also be dressed very casually."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzM3ByS1ZREAE,"Service was slow. Food was decent at best. Definitely overpay for the ""vegan"" experience at this restaurant"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzM3BTWGJnEAE,"Alexandra is hands down the most professional, kind, and fantastic person we've ever met, turned a typical night out into an absolute pleasure from making the whole order easy and precise, while keeping up on drinks without inhibiting the conversation of our table, it was truly magical to have such a smooth and seamless organic experience with such phenomenal customer service, and the picture attached is an empty plate because I ate absolutely everything put in front of me the quality and texture of the food is supreme and uncontested to anywhere in Omaha"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNcl9iWlFnEAE,"Cozy atmosphere. Reservations recommended on weekends. Food is delicious except neither of us cared for the burger. There was just too much thickness and weirdness, difficult to get through more than a bite.

Service wasn’t a 5- server spent too much time chatting with coworkers than being attentive to refilling water, correcting our order, etc. An off day, will give another try.

Overall I’d recommend for those that want a truly vegan experience. We were looking forward to the ‘famous’ snicker dessert only to find it wasn’t on the menu. Milkshake was phenomenal and the strawberry sundae (with nuts) was superb!"

I had the cashew-based mac and cheese, and it was awful! My husband had some fake meat dish. We couldn't get over the weird tastes at textures, so everything was unappealing."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwZzRQU3RBRRAB,Food and dessert was amazing. Hostess and waitress (we sat at the bar) were lovely. I highly recommend this place. And-- get the ice cream sundae.

It was busy but coming from out of town, we'd made reservations. There's a good selection of imaginative dishes and everything we've tried over many trips has been excellent. The chicken fried bowl with cauliflower mash and kale was over the top delicious. I wouldn't dream of going through Omaha without stopping at Modern Love."

Only reason I gave 4 and not 5 stars was 1. my fries were cold when I got them and 2. the restaurant was a little more upscale than I anticipated.  Prices for some items were a little high but well worth it.  Because it was upscale, the decor seemed a bit sterile and not as fun as vegan restaurants in Chicago and Denver.  Highly recommend though, if you are vegan and in the area, definitely check it out.  Seitan wings were amazing.  Staff was friendly and cool."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwdWRqXzVBRRAB,"Every time I go to modern love in impressed. This recent trip was for my mother's birthday. We are both going vegan so I decided to give her a real treat. She got the modern burger, a seitan and lentil burger with all the fixins as well as American style cashew cheese. Being new to veganism she found it odd but tasty. (She was an omnivore only a month ago.) We split a side of seitan buffalo wings. They have a delightful texture to sink your teeth into and the homemade ranch dipping sauce can satisfy any Midwesterner! I got the mac & shews. It comes with roasted cauliflower that was cooked well and still crunchy, the kale was soft and flavorful, the cornmeal crusted tofu reminds me a bit of fish sticks (which is awesome), and the mac itself was perfectly cooked and coated in a creamy savory increasingly cheesy tasting cashew cheese sauce. I also treated myself to a chickpea cutlet; a deliciously chewy addition to the mac. In definitely returning and will be bringing friends."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwd1lDeTFnRRAB,Food tastes great! Want to go back and try some different items!

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwenZfS3JBRRAB,"Tasty options, HUGE portions and a great wine line-up.  Service was great, staff was friendly and genuine. We ordered a few apps and a few entrees:

Chilled beet soup: Delicious, 2nd best thing on the table! Huge bowl!

Seitan Buffalo Wings: Tasty, strong buffalo sauce flavor.

Cauliflower Wings (part of the special menu for restaurant week): Tasty

Chimichanga: OK, the sides were just OK as well.

Chick'n Fried Steak: OK, I thought it lacked a 'kick'. A bland take on a meaty standard.

Mac N' Shews: Star of the show! Delicious, tangy, filling. I'd get this and the beet soup again and again!"

There was something floating in my water but my server was quick to grab me a new cup so I really appreciated that. Unfortunately, as I was leaning back in my seat my friend pointed out to me a bug that was crawling on the seating. I felt a bit grossed out by that and swatted it away with my napkin.
With having a bug nearly crawl on me plus the dirty cup, I think it will be a while before I give this place another chance..."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVODhMbHhBRRAB,Always wonderful.   Great service and incredible food.  So delicious.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVdzRuX1ZnEAE,"I am impressed.  Great flavor combinations. There was a kick to the barbecue tofu entree.  I appreciated the heat but it was too sharp for my wife.  You really really want to save room for dessert so split an entree.  My daughter had one of the"" burgers"". Amazing flavor from all vegan ingredients.  I recommend the peach cinnamon roll dessert.  The vegan ice cream was the ultimate topper on the peach cinnamon roll.

Staff was superb and knowable. We are from Chicago area on our way to Colorado vacation and we were very happy to find a place like this.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVM1lfbFNREAE,"I was pretty excited to come to this place. I should say, walking in, it seemed pretty swanky which was great. I would assume that a place like this would be focused on creating an experience for the person dining in. I eat out at restaurants frequently and I love coming to a place and feeling comfortable and feeling like I know I will be taken care of.  Unfortunately, this was not the case here. Our server was not the friendliest. We ordered a bottle of wine and she brought the wine out, and I should add, she nearly tore the cork in half (because she didn’t start the corkscrew in the center of the cork) and then just poured the wine. Usually you get to try a little, especially at a place like this. Nope! Just poured the wine and walked away. Turns out, she brought a different wine than what we ordered. We tried for the next 20 minutes to get her attention and she kept giving us the cold shoulder, avoiding eye contact. I worked in food service for over 25 years. If a customer is making eye contact, they need something. When our food came she came with another server and dropped one dish and bailed! I had to tell the other poor gal that she brought us the wrong wine. When she finally came back, it was super awkward. She owned up to her mistake but just asked if we liked the wine we had. We said It was OK, but we were being polite. It wasn’t that great. She just said ok and then bailed again. i hate feeling super awkward like that. The food was really good, but if you can’t train your servers to take care of folks, it’s not a place I’ll return to, no matter how good the food is."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVM2FXYm1RRRAB,1st time trying Vegan it was 👍 for die hard meat eater.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVemJIaWd3RRAB,I always have to stop by when I'm in Omaha. It's the best.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVeWJQX2dRRRAB,"We had the brussel sprout appetizer, nachos, and chana masala. Everything exceeded expectations, we were both very happy. I would definitely make this a habit if I lived here, but even as one place chosen for a weekend expedition trip, I would not have chosen differently in retrospect. It's hard to envision another place that would deliver as effectively on every level."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVb2VpbXdBRRAB,"Lives amply up to its reputation as one of the finest vegan restaurants in the USA... Very reasonable prices for happy hour, given the amazing quality of the ""comfort"" food menu, and wine selection."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVZ2N1S0N3EAE,"Food is excellent, prices are appropriate for specialty dining option, and wait time is not bad even on the busiest of nights. You can even call ahead if you want a WFPB menu option and they will accommodate accordingly!!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVM29YMndRRRAB,The title may say vegan but don't let that intimidate anyone. The food is out of this world and you wouldn't know it was all plant based.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVenJPVHR3RRAB,Amazing food!  I'll be back
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVam9Tc3hnRRAB,"Excellent!! I've been twice and both times have been wonderful experiences. My brother and his wife asked me ""is that place really that good? Its vegan!"" And YES it is. I am absolutely NOT a vegan. Not even in the neighborhood of vegetarian. This place is an absolute testament to how good vegan and gluten free foods can be. Yummy, great service, knowledgable wait staff, great cocktails and beer selection. Just great."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVb3BHeWh3RRAB,"It's outstanding vegan fare. The service was excellent, the location was a very short walk from parking (free with validated ticket).
I had been wanting to go for a while, as the owner Isa Moskowitz has written a few of my favorite cookbooks. I was blown away.
The prices were also very reasonable.
We'll definitely be coming back."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVMU9uMk13EAE,"We live in Kansas City and spent a few days in Omaha on vacation. It would have been worth the drive to Omaha from KC just to eat here.
The kohlrabi poutine was a whimsical take on the classic dish from where I grew up, but so tasty that I’d choose this over the real deal any day. My wife loved the “Mac and Cheese”. The risotto was gorgeous and every element, while perfect individually, blended into a fabulous harmonious whole.
Best vegan meal I’ve ever had. Our sampling of the menu leaves us feeling like we could have ordered anything and left just as satisfied."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVMVBHS1BREAE,Simply Amazing!!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVbE5IYWR3EAE,"Wow. Just wow. I received this location as a recommendation at a brewery the night before and my vegetarian friend made it a must for our Omaha trip. I’m so glad I agreed to go. THIS PLACE IS SO GOOD & PRETTY. Everything we tried was scrumptious and I didn’t care that it was all vegan because it was better than most actual meat plates I’ve had!  The dishes each came out with a stunning arrangement that complemented the fun pink booths they have. The true gem would be the desert I’d seen on their Instagram earlier that wasn’t on their actual printed menu. This pride special was not only wonderfully colorful but a true delight to eat. Each color brought a new flavor into the mix that all fit extremely well. The fact that lavender was in it at all made me know it was a mhsr. If you’re in Omaha at all, vegans and carnivores alike, you most definitely need to check this place out. Spectacular. 10/10."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVcEt6TFJnEAE,"Best vegan restaurant in the US. They do dinner and they do it amazingly well. They do seitan perfectly as well. It’s an amazing dining experience topped off with some of the neat desserts I’ve ever tasted. We tried the lemon cheesecake, phenomenal, and the Snickers pie, also phenomenal. Amazing on all fronts."

Minus what I think was an overly strong taragon, the Watermelon Beats & Brie were awesome.
Nachos were great!  My kids fought over those.
Fried mozarella was really good too.  Another favorite with the kids.
Avacado Toast was so-so.
Cherry Soda was special...it tasted like a cherry pie.  You can actually taste the individual cherry, cinnamon, & vanilla flavors
Watermelon Agua Fresca was very refreshing and delicious.
Peach Kombucha was good as well.

Servers were very friendly and the restaurant has a great vibe.  I would recommend this establishment to anyone vegan or not."

It looks as good as the pictures."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZdTlEUmZnEAE,I had to try each dish my group choose and each one was delicious!  The masala dish was my favorite.  Very creative take on food.

We Googled fine dining restaurants and a million steakhouses came up. We asked the front desk at our hotel for a vegetable forward restaurant. We didn’t realize Modern Love was a vegan restaurant.

Modern Love debunks all the silly vegan stereotypes and myths...and proves that veganism is vibrant, romantic, comforting, and mouth-watering delicious (all at the same time)!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZdnA2ak5nEAE,"First time eating at an all-vegan restaurant and I must say, I was pleasantly surprised. The atmosphere was very modern yet still very cozy. We were greeted right away when we arrived and sat down in a cozy booth a couple of minutes later! While looking through the rather extensive menu, we settled on some drinks, including an interesting Kombucha and a very drinkable glass of Riesling.  The Avocado Garlic Bread was good, although the bread had become a little soggy underneath the avocado, arugula and a little bit heavy handed on the truffle oil. We also tasted the Summer Squash Chana Masala and Mushroom Bourguignon. Both dishes were also pleasant although the Mushroom was the favorite dish of the night. Service was excellent and friendly even though we were one of the last tables of the evening. We didn’t have time to look at the dessert menu but regardless we were way to full anyway. I’ll have to save it for next time I’m in Omaha!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZcnRuYld3EAE,My first visit was for mother's day brunch. The portobello steak salad I had was excellent and our server was charming and attentive.

We ordered Cauliflower Peanut Wings and Mozzarella Balls(MUST GET!) for our appetizers! I had the Masala w/ tofu which was AMAZING and my friend had the special. We both enjoyed the Snickers pie after. Our glasses were topped off the entire time. Arlo was our server, super nice and friendly!! I will drive the two hours one way to have dinner here again!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZOHVieUp3EAE,"Five BIG stars for Modern Love from two fat and happy vegans! :) We were visiting family in Omaha one weekend and one of them wanted to take us here because it was all vegan. We didn't know what to expect, but upon looking at the menu, I was floored by how many things they offered vegan. Fried mozzarella, nahos, seitan buffalo wings, poutine (OMG), lasagna, mac n cheese, seitan shawarma, and the list keeps going. Eventually we settled on the fried mozz and nachos for apps, lasagna, mushroom swizz burger, and shawarma for dinner, and a blackberry cheesecake and snickers pie for dessert. Needless to say, we had to be rolled out of the restaurant afterwards but it was so worth it. This place is a little pricier than most, but considering what they're offering, you won't mind paying for it. I can't wait to go back the next time we visit!"

I love it when I can go to a restaurant and order ANYTHING I want, since I eat a plant-based diet. The entree was a spicy curry, which was delicious. Great wine and lovely staff. This is the place we go for special occasions and it has never disappointed me. The new location is wonderful! Setting was nice too. Recommend to make a reservation."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNZaUxfLWZBEAE,"It was ok. We were seated promptly,  but the tables are tiny and cramped together so we could hear everyone's conversations around us. We're not vegan, but we do regularly eat vegan meals, so have some experience. I am sensitive to spicy things, so I asked the waitress if there was *any* kick at all for a few things on the menu that looked good, and weren't already rated with a spicy symbol. After reassurance from the waitress the was *no* spicy-ness, I got Mac and Cashews. It was so fiery, I could only eat a few bites. So I switched meals with my dining companion who had ordered the Chickpea Parmesean Cutlets, though I could eat it,  it didn't stand out as spectacular. We shared a raspberry cheesecake for dessert (that was excellent). Overall,  our waitress was inattentive and slow and the food was priced much higher than reasonable (a milkshake was $8). It was fine, but will not go out of our way to go again."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvcnVTemZnEAE,"One of my favorite places to eat in Omaha. Don't let the vegan fare turn you off, the food is amazing in its own right.

The Mac & Shews is a good starting place for those who are a bit pickier, but I would recommend the Root Vegetable Coconut Curry for those looking to try something new.

The desserts are fantastic and I always recommend trying a signature cocktail for date night."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURvMTRXSmJ3EAE,The best part of my trip to Omaha. Everything we had was delicous- strongly recommend the boozy milkshakes!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURvMS1ySmVnEAE,This was magical!!!!!!

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURvenVxcEdREAE,It was an experience. I’m not a vegan or vegetarian but felt the menu had plenty of options that were appealing. It would not be a go to place for us on the regular but gives us an option when my sister and her husband come in who are vegans !
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURvenVpOUZnEAE,I've been to the new location at midtown crossing several times. I've had so many bad experiences that I do not plan to return. The food is overpriced and not worth the hype and servers are snotty and aloof.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURvckpXYTBnRRAB,Phenomenal Vegan food. Anyone would like it. Prices are definitely high. But I can't argue too much because the way it was presented to you was art in my opinion. Very satisfying food. Everyone was really nice to me there.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURvdVA3bGZ3EAE,Went there for a team dinner. The food was delicious and it's truly an art to create delicious vegan equivalents of some.of my favorite foods.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURvb05lMExnEAE,Simply amazing!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURvb01XMG1BRRAB,"I feel as if Micah must be a douchebag, and seems to confuse vegans with hipsters in his stereotyping. Vegans come in all forms, they're simply people who believe killing and exploiting sentient beings is wrong. That being said, the place is a bit expensive. I honestly preferred Block 16's vegan block burger over Modern Love's, but they still have a lot of good food, and while I don't think it's the best out there, I'll eat here whenever I'm in town to show support for a vegan only restaurant."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvODV6MEpBEAE,"This place generally sucks, every experience I've had has been trash. Expensive food that you don't really get what you ask for vague descriptions and half the time bad service been here about 5 times and I gotta say it's either burned because it's covering up that it already tastes bad, or they have a few good overpriced options that they are out of on the day you decide you want it. The menu is always the same and there isn't any variation or variety to any of it over the years it's only gotten worse and more pretentious and annoying if anything changes."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvZ2J6WklREAE,"As the wife and I worked on Valentines this year we decided on a weekend date. We arrived around 7pm and were asked if we had reservations. We did not but still got seated within 2 minutes as they just had another couple leave. The environment in here was relaxing, I myself enjoyed the decor. We ordered La Poutine Moderne for our starter. I thought this was spot on. Good flavor. Wife doesn't like onions as much and there was a good amount but she still enjoyed it as well. She got the Chickpea Bacon Ranch Sandwich and potato salad. She wasn't a fan of the capers in the potato salad but I thought it was a genius way to add some new flavors. I took a bite of her sandwich and it was absolutely delicious. I ordered the Chickpea Cutlet Parmesan. Everything on my plate was delicious too and I had enough for leftovers. Their kombucha on tap was great too. We need more restaurants like this in the area! We ordered the Banana Tiramisu Bundtcake to go for dessert and just had our first bite. Props to our waitress who heard us say a lot of things in our conversation that could have been taken way out of context but was still super friendly. If you want to try some vegan meals away from home Modern Love is where it's at! The only reason I cannot give 5 stars was the wait time on our food."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJal9LSHJnRRAB,So trying vegan eateries as we travel to watch our son play hockey.first time to Omaha. Had high Hope's for modern love but was not impressed. Had a cheese burger and wanted my side of fries omitted and a order of poutine. Not possible. The burger was heavy and dry . The bread was same. They can take a lesson or two from meat on main or heart choices. On the plus side the milkshake was delicious.

Only nitpick is the wine pours. Teensy. You're better off getting a beer."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJdy11RERREAE,The atmosphere is relaxing and the staff are friendly. The food is high-quality and filling. The dessert is DELICIOUS! Great vegan restaurant. My only request would be to have access to nutrition labels or calorie numbers for each item.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJdzZ1Wml3RRAB,"Great little Omaha gem. Good for vegans and meat-eaters alike. Cauliflower hot wings you're amazing for man who likes flavor and chicken wings..... I will go out of my way for these again and again.
The staff was very pleasant and helpful felt at home making food decisions with them assisting.
The menu had a great variety of styles and types of foods. Each full of flavors that will bring you back again and again.
My daughter and I love this place and so do our friends who frequents the old and now the new restaurant."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJX2FxZTVRRRAB,Food was really good we ordered the bqq seitan wings which were incredible!! Spicy and tangy! The cutlet was also really tasty and really filling. The price point and the cookies and cream cheese cake is where I took a star for. There are so many Amazing vegan desserts and that was not one of their best. Will definitely try other things on the menu though
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJM2Rlb1B3EAE,We arrived later in the evening traveling back to Chicago.  We wanted something healthy and tasty.  We ordered the curry and the burger.  I arrived at the restaurant to pick up our order and was greeted by incredible staff.  It sounded like they got along.  The burger and fries were impeccable.  I wish the restaurant was in Chicago as I would go back again.  The curry had a great flavor too.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJd2VYWjJ3RRAB,"First time here and it was GREAT.  I was a little skeptical based on reviews of the new location over the old but glad we went anyway.  Had the nachos to start, meatloaf for meal and finished with cookies and cream cheesecake and cocktails, too.  We had to try it all as a first vegan restaurant experience (and definitely carnivores).  Ticket for 2 cocktails, app, 2 entrees and split dessert with tip was just $100.  A little pricey but good for a special night out.

FOOD IS FABULOUS!!!  Service was good, too.  Only thing is those tables are so darn small, but the server kept it clear and manageable.

Will be back again!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJX3Y3d2Z3EAE,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJdnRPeUtREAE,"I enjoyed the restaurant . Food was good, and had plenty of taste. Didnt enjoy the textures of the fake meat and cheese. Was worth the try and I was pleased with our visit. Probably won’t be back tho, vegan food isn’t my thing , but I can’t give anyone a reason not to try the restaurant. Cocktails were very good!
I had the vegan version of a burrito bowl, tasted good."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJbnR6M1d3EAE,This place is great. Is funky without being pretentious and the food is delicious. Highly recommend.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJbnVUWUNBEAE,I'm not a vegan. Not even remotely. This is a great restaurant. The things they can do with vegetables is astounding. An associate of mine ordered the Mac n chews (Mac and cheese) where the cheese is made from cashews. It was brilliant. You would not have known it wasn't Mac and cheese. Great flavors in everything I tried. Friendly service. Knowledgeable service. Vegan. For sure vegan. Even the dessert. Vegan. Themes right. Doesn't matter you will enjoy the service. atmosphere and most of all the great food. Go give it a try if you haven't.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJN3U2NUFREAE,"I have been to many vegan restaurants in the midwest and Modern Love is by far my favorite! Vegan or not, all will love this place. The food & cocktails are always amazing and switched up for according seasons. The atmosphere and staff are incredibly inviting. The new location is gorgeous. No wonder it is always packed. Get a reservation!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJN3M2dWxRRRAB,"It was basically junk food, but good for you!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJcHNXcXNnRRAB,Chose this spot as a stop between Chicago and Colorado.. great decision! Amazing food. Definitely go for the buffalo cauliflower wings!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJLXZleUhBEAE,"I discovered PPK many years ago and love Isa’s recipes and techniques, so I’ve been wanting to go here since it opened. Finally, we decided to take a little road trip from Chicago for NYE. We wanted to try as much as possible, so we ordered the pix fixe and a couple other items from the regular menu. Everything was incredible and in perfect portions. Lobster mac and cheese, chicken pot pie, bacon wrapped dates, black eyed pea crab cakes... OMG!
The service is top notch, the atmosphere is fun, the music is great, and those velvety bar stools are so cozy. Of course we stayed for an after dinner drink because we didn’t want to leave, but also saw some cocktails that needed to be had. I can’t wait to go back! Thank you Isa and crew!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJLW8zWEdREAE,Delicious vegan food.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJLXJXRHR3RRAB,Love the Midtown location. I ventured there with my son inside two of my favourite people! The waitstaff here is absolutely amazing. In the food well he hands down the best. If you are looking for amazing vegetarian and vegan selections this is your restaurant.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJMnN6LTNRRRAB,"Loved it! I'm not vegetarian but I'd still recommend going here. Had the curry with tofu. Originally I didn't order tofu but it came out with it, I tried it, and it absolutely made the dish."

A must stop for lovers of all food types - but YES it’s all vegan.  Tonight was my second time here and it did not disappoint, I had a blacked tofu Alfredo and the  Snickers pie (to go). I have also had the burrito bowl - this might be my favorite."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJbUtlb2lRRRAB,The best restaurant. Beautiful space and look at this pecan lentil meatloaf. The chickpea cutlet Parm was also perfection. Another impressive experience!

I only wish they were open more hours, but I understand they have to do what's best for their business. The price is on the higher end a bit, can't eat there everyday. However, if I could I would eat there everyday. The best vegan restaurant to go to in Omaha hands down."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNJdjZYTXJRRRAB,"I'm not a vegan.
I think the delivery of the food was good though not everything hit a 5 star for me (details below). However I feel like it's harder to do vegan foods which is why I did give them a 5.

Hits:
Definitely go for the fried mozzarella which is actually a cashew fauxmage.
The Walnut chorizo on the nachos were fantastic.
Warm Apple tart: this was about a 4 for me

Half Misses?: These weren't terrible, but more average and I think there might be better things to order
Seitan brisket: there was an overly watery portion of my dish which made the dish not fantastic. The over fried part of the brisket was noticeable. they weren't really emulating beef... It was much more like pork and I don't know how I felt about that.
Chickpea cutlet parmesan: I didn't mind this but my gf who actually ordered it didn't finish it and didn't want to pack it home. The pasta that came with it was a bit lack luster as well.
Cookies n cream cheesecake: I've just had better vegan cheesecakes. This was a 3 star item

Side note:
they serve tea from the tea Smith
They will validate your parking from the big parking structure
They have cute wooden straws with their drinks

Service was interesting. I didn't do a full service review but my tea could have been refilled more (it was empty for a long time, the server missed it twice, I'm not sure if the client is expected to ask instead of being asked). The empty appetizer dish that we had finished for a long time sat at the table for a very long time. They were pretty busy though. Looked like a full restaurant."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNJN3NEOEJBEAE,"Fantastic! The other reviews probably cover anything that I can say, but this place is wonderful. The staff are friendly, service is prompt, and the food is out of this world. I recommend if you are a vegan or not, you will not be disappointed."

There space is fun, comfortable and inviting.  I've changed to a strictly plant based diet and ML is a great reward."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvdWNlTzBBRRAB,"Good to great food.  Decent to great service.  The new building is much better than the old one.  Far more quiet too, so you can have a conversation which was impossible before the move.  I wish that I could give this restaurant 5 stars but the best dish (Mac and shews) is just too inconsistent from season to season."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR3bU9tS1p3EAE,Great gem in Omaha. The new building is much bigger and really nice. The food is amazing (try the schnitzel and the Brussels Aioli). I love that Omaha has an amazing vegan restaurant...
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR3akxMWGJREAE,Great food. Great vibe. Friendly staff. Accommodating to and careful with allergies.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR3MnFMZC1BRRAB,Ordered the chickpea bacon ranch which had great flavor and crunch. Loved it. With the trip!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnNF8yRTN3RRAB,"Food is good, wish they marinated the tofu for the Mac and shews. Some of the portions are far too expensive for what you get. Five cauliflower wings for $12 seems steep especially when you leave as hungry as ya come in.
round two was worst
the burger is edible but the special sauce is disgusting, got a salad on the side and pretty sure that they use the special sauce on it which rendered it inedible (wish i woulda got the fries instead or the potato salad because it was disgusting)
Shakes are fairly decent, the matcha mint with caramel is weird regret spending the $8 on it
some of the staff is still incredibly rude some of them are extremely kind
honestly the place is worth it if ur a vegan not wanting to cook junky food at home but it'd probably be tastier if u did"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR3MUlfc3BRRRAB,"This place is definitely top 5 of all vegan places I have tried since venturing out in the last year. I would recommend making reservations. We waited about 15 minutes on Friday night around 7:00 PM for a party of two. The atmosphere is welcoming and the staff is friendly.

We sampled the Garlic Parmesan Cauliflower Wings, Portobello Steak Salad, and Autumn Chana Masala. The masala was my least favorite of the three. It tasted more like a chili to me and was missing a bit of texture.  The cauliflower left me feeling excited and inspired and the portobello was cooked to perfection.

I am looking forward to sampling more dishes and will provide updates in the future."
ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBdFBVZRAB,"My partner and I drove two hours to Modern Love yesterday for our reservations and had a truly upsetting experience.
To begin with we were sat at the smallest table I've ever seen in a restaurant and had to put our waters and water pitcher on the window ledge to fit our menus/plates etcs on the table.
Then it seemed like everyone around us was attended and served first. We were not able to even order our entrees until 45 min.s in.
We rarely saw our server and when we did she rushed through everything she said so we weren't able to ask many questions or talk to her at all.
The food was a little bland considering what it cost but the portions are great. Also the glasses of prosecco are generous.
The quinoa and beans in our tempeh bowl were buried, mushy and had no flavor.
Ans we had many questions throughout the service that we had to get up and find someone to answer because we rarely saw our server.
We were in the restaurant a total of 2 hours and only spent 15 minutes actually eating. For the drive and the amount we paid for the food we are extremely unhappy and will not even consider returning."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBNnRyNTlnRRAB,It was worth the drive to Omaha for a restaurant where I can choose anything. The staff was nice. Looking forward to the new location which will hopefully have more space
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRbVAycVpnEAE,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURncmZiaWh3RRAB,Nice place and nice people. The food is pretty good but not the best vegetarian I have had
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBNmFieU9REAE,"Modern Love is great! Been here many times and almost never fails to be amazing...and when it wasn't amazing, they TOTALLY made up for it with excellent service! I can't wait for the new location to open. I WILL say though, my favorite appetizer was the Brussels with aioli and they've been changed out for Brussels with Chimichurri sauce...not a fan but they weren't terrible either. Anything with the chickpea cutlets is worth a try and the nachos molo are ridiculously good. We have brought numerous non-vegans here and all of them have enjoyed their meals. Can't recommend Modern Love enough!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBa0tuWXd3RRAB,"Cute place, love the food! 👍"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBOE1pdGlnRRAB,Absolutely amazing! Great service and wonderful food!

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnNHQ3YXZ3RRAB,Mac n shews and bbq cauliflower 😋
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBOWR5T0lnEAE,Now I have a place I could go out with my Vegan friend. The food is delicious. Love mozzarella balls.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBM3BQZnFRRRAB,As a vegetarian I enjoyed a restaurant where I didn't have to search for food that had not meat. I really like the vibe and the food was delicious. ☺️👍🏻
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnNWVEa0lnEAE,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnOElUcnZnRRAB,"Amazing vegan food!  We started with the Nachos Molo, and it left us wanting more.  Our main dishes included the Coconut Chana Masala and the Chickpea Bacon Ranch Sandwich, both tasted amazing.  Our drinks complemented well: a Watermelon Margarita and Schilling Beer Company's Pineapple Passionfruit Cider.  And to end this incredible meal we split the Peanut Butter Snickers pie for dessert.  We will be back!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRb29LV2lBRRAB,Wonderful atmosphere good service food is very good.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnbXBlT0hBEAE,Food was great: fresh and creative.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBMVBDWXB3RRAB,"Not as good as 3 years ago.
Appetizers were tasty but main dishes lacked flavor. Disappointing for the price.
Not sure I'll be back.  Maybe for an appetizer and dessert.  Staff friendly enough and very clean.  Nutritious. Always busy.

Close quarters. Parking tight and not entirely paved, watch for mud puddles. And other drivers. The lot is contiguous with the neighboring bar and they are territorial per the signs posted. It's not easy to park in the neighborhood but could be done if you are halfway fit."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBNGJ1dGx3RRAB,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNneV9EOTVRRRAB,"Really creative vegan cooking that will leave you satisfied and wanting to come back again. I had the chickpea parmesean with marinara. Absolutely delicious with a lovely tomato tang. For dessert the snickers pie was decandently delicious with rich chocolate ganache, salted caramel and peanuts. Yum! The rhubarb margarita was refreshing and tart!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURndnZtd2lBRRAB,"Best of the best vegan restaurants! Small in size, small menu however LARGE flavor and no dish will disappoint! I'd recommend the Chicken Parmesan or Chickpea Avacado Ranch sandwich. But like I said, everything is full of flavor. Lets not forget there beers and craft cocktails...again a small selection but something for everyone I believe. Oh....and dont forget dessert!  We are making this a twice a month date night!  Another quick recommendation is to call and get a reservation."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRb0t6TWRnEAE,"It's amazing what these people are able to do with vegan food. I am not a vegan - I just came with a friend and was impressed by the creativity and taste here. If you can appreciate the food genre and be open-minded, you'll like this place regardless of not being a vegan. GET DESSERT!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBNUluYjhnRRAB,"Love this restaurant with all my heart. I can have a bad day and after being in this place surrounded by it’s good homie positive energy and delicious foods....I am back to feeling like I’m in some glorious afterlife.

Thank Isa for bringing your talents to Omaha and I cannot wait for the restaurant to relocate to Midtown Crossing! Xoxoxoxo"

I like the idea of the small menu, but it was hard to decide.  I chose the chickpea parm.  After the wait, it arrived luke warm. Got dessert to go, we'll see how that is."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3ejczZGVBEAE,"It's absolutely our favorite restaurant of all time. Not just vegan restaurant, any restaurant. The flavors they have imagined together are at the very least deliciously dreamy. So thankful for this place!"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURndktpclFnEAE,"We were traveling through the city and called ahead for takeout. We had the Nachos Molo, the Modern Cheeseburger x2, the Blackberry Nectarine pie and the Peanut Butter Snickers pie. Everything was amazing. The cheeseburgers were VERY large and we could have shared 1 instead. They put the food into compostable containers instead of plastic, a detail I appreciate very much. I wish we lived closer and if we did I would eat here all the time. Very well done!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBb1p2bE13EAE,"Good food, service, and atmosphere. Our server had told us that the portions were huge. So we split a side an entree and a dessert. The Buffalo wings were amazing, the stroganoff need a little salt and the ice cream sundae was really tasty. The only problem here is the size of the entree. It was less than huge and less than a portion to share. We enjoyed, but we left a little hungry. I recommend coming to get some vegan food and trying the well made eats. Everything is made in house, which I always like to hear. The less prepackaged food that I can eat the better."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnbVBpMVlnEAE,Pricey but worthwhile

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNna01YZlRBEAE,Best vegan food in Omaha hands down! Great locale and fantastic seasonal menu. Try their cashew cheese it's delicious. I hope they expand more places because their restaurant is one of the best in Omaha hands down.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURndWRqam53RRAB,"I can't leave a review of the food, but I can about their hours posted.  We were travelling across the county and excited to eat there this past Sunday.  After being in the car for 10 hours, we arrived at 8:20.  Their hours say they close at 9:00.  We were promptly told that their kitchen closes at 8:30 and we could purchases desserts only.  The website does not indicate the kitchen closes at 8:30, so this was a waste of time for us and disappointing that we couldn't even get food to go (we already know what we wanted) as we asked about that too.  We passed on the desserts and went to another local establishment (spent $100) that had vegan options and it turned out to be a wonderful decision."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNneXEtcVRnEAE,"Seitan buffalo wings! Love them!  Have them everytime I go as an appetizer.  Last time I went, also had the buffalo mac & cheese.  Each time I visit it's a wonderful surprise!!!"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRdmVQQmdnRRAB,"The food there is excellent, I seem to never be able to find any room for their amazing desserts.  The best restaurant in town, just so happens to be vegan as well.  6 stars."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRcUpQZnpRRRAB,Delicious! Friendly Vegan!?
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRZ2RIZHhRRRAB,"Grab the food to go and you will be in heaven! However delicious food should not come with horrid customer service. We went out for a girls night with our Bride-to-Be and they literally all but forgot our table!!! (We obviously made a reservation for this event.) Our waitress went to refill our water and literally never brought it back. We ordered an insane amount of food to try everything and were given one glass of water and a set of drinks the whole night. I've never been so disappointed in a restaurant. Grab the food to go. Or go to Barnes and Noble and buy the cookbooks that  the creator of restraunt has published including ""Isa Does It"" and ""Veganomicon."""
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNndHJTNlB3EAE,"Incredible! So good! So filling! Modern Love's house patty, sesame seed bun, cashew cheddar, pickles, tomato, red onion, lettuce, and special sauce. Wonderful staff and service. Would highly recommend to anyone!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRb29maGlBRRAB,"We ate here tonight and savored every bite! We started with the Buffalo Wings which I'm still astonished weren't made of meat. I had the Curry and my husband had a Mac and Cheese (but not actually cheese) bowl. Both were seasoned perfectly, beautifully plated, and obviously made from the freshest ingredients. The desserts were devine! We had Carrot Cake and the Snicker Pie, which melted in our mouths. Our server was attentive and quick. When you go, be sure to make reservations, and expect a tight fit in the parking lot. The portions are perfect-size but my husband and I discussed how patrons (such as our parents who appreciate the large, starchy portions of an old supper club), might be disappointed by the serving size. but overall, a unique and mouthwatering dining experience!"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNncW92b2FnEAE,My first time eating at a vegan restaurant.  Everything was amazing!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnOHBmbF93RRAB,"I decided to give this place a shot after hearing so much about it. I highly recommend a reservation, as it was packed on a Thursday night. The restaurant is small and quite loud, but the service was amazing! I had their daily special of fried mushroom, kale slaw, gravy, and a corn muffin with their Elvis pie. The dinner was good, but I don't think vegan is for me. They called it their ""KFC"" which was too much. The slaw and muffin were quite good. The pie had a graham cracker crust with pb custard, bananas, and a chocolate ganache topping. The flavors were all good, but I felt the chocolate kind of overpowered the others. Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone who is adventurous with their food. I will definitely be back to try another of their meals."

ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnNUp0ZRAB,"When I was pregnant with my second child, this was my go to place. I love their salads! Fresh and flavorful. They have very good cakes too. The staff was warm and always helpful. I just love it here."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRbkpDU2F3EAE,Such a lovely place to dine. Make a reservation because even when I come here by myself which is most of the time there is a wait.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBaklxUHl3RRAB,"I'm not big on the whole vegan lifestyle, that should be apparent with all my BBQ reviews, but this place puts good flavor in there food and the wait staff was awesome, as always my date wasn't half bad and is begging me to go again regardless of the hour & half drive."

Try something new, it may surprise you how good it is! You should respect the expertise and skill as it served though

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBZ182S1dBEAE,"Dined here this past weekend with a group of 11. I decided to try the Bacon Cheeseburger but it only took one bite for me to give it a NOPE! I'm not one to give up on a dish but this was especially gross. As I brought the burger towards my face I started to smell something like a wet sock. After my first bite, I found that the char on the patty made it taste like a dirty rug. The bacon was mushy, which fit right in with the rest of the burger. My wife didn't believe me, but almost puked after giving it a taste. More people in my group gave it a shot and the burger was successful at delivering many frowning faces.

The sprouts app was great and the Gnocchi was tasty. We decided to try the cheese cake, but only 1 out of 11 in our group actually thought it was OK. Everyone else thought it was horrible. I would come here again but I definitely know what to avoid on the menu."

We had the quesadilla for appetizer and it was the best quesadilla we have ever had. We had the gingerbread cheesecake and the modern sundae for dessert. I highly recommend the sundae. <3 I seriously am so sad that we live out of state because when we go back home  in going to miss this place.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRMGZuMmxRRRAB,"So according to the reviews this is the best vegan place in Omaha, but that is only because this place is literally the only 100% vegan joint in Omaha. The pasta was hoooorrrrriiibbllleeeee! BUT it’s nothing that had to do with Modern Love, I just learned that I hate that style of pasta. The buffalo wings were great. I think the gyro was pretty good but my wife thought it was horrible. The apple pie bread pudding was amaaaazzziiiinnnngggg! All in all this place wasn’t that great though."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRcmV1MWVREAE,"This place is a vegan gem in the largely meat-centtic Omaha metro. We had cauliflower buffalo wings as an appetizer and they were fantastic - spicy, crispy, and drizzled with a nice creamy sauce. The Mac and Shrew was delicious - perfectly breaded, crispy tofu over a solid vegan Mac n cheese. The Spicy Marinara Gnocchi was also amazing - very flavorful sauce over soft fluffy potato pasta topped with the best vegan ricotta I've ever tasted. The desserts were also very good - a delicious peanut butter and chocolate pie as well as a tasty sundae with vegan ice cream that beats most dairy ice cream any day. Its kinda expensive but 💯 worth it."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNneFBHMk1nEAE,We enjoy eating at Modern Love. Vegan and delicious entrees. A jewel in Omaha.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnNXNPNDl3RRAB,Amazing vegan food.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnd05ublV3EAE,Try it! It's great!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRbFlfV1d3EAE,"Went there about a year ago.  My wife is vegetarian, I am not, but I have eaten a lot of vegetarian and some vegan dishes in my day. The place was packed, so obviously doing well. However, the waitress was borderline rude, and both my wife and myself thought the food to be average and over-priced. Won't be back."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRZy1TaDZRRRAB,"So happy to find a dedicated vegan joint in Omaha, where I never thought I would find one.  I ordered the wings and mac and cheese and loved both of them.  Will definitely be back when I'm in the area.  We did not make a reservation and got lucky to arrive with a table to sit at.  If you plan on going here on a weekend evening, make a reservation!"

Rich, delicious flavors, and mouth feel that rivals the animal versions of their dishes. Oh, and desserts that you can taste by just looking at the menu. Honestly didn't know what to expect. Small with intimate atmosphere, perfect for couples night out. Priced in the medium range but so freaking worth it. Afford yourself the pleasure, you won't regret it."

The service was genuinely friendly and the waiters product knowledge was excellent. Also had a great Iowan beer.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnbnJpRl9nRRAB,"My husband and I drove 7 hours out of the way on our road trip to go to Modern Love. It was so worth it! Our server was wonderful and our meal was incredible. The Brussels sprouts were amazing! I had the Mac and Shews and my husband had the gnocchi. Both were delicious. Definitely save room for dessert too!  This was probably a once in a lifetime experience for us, due to location, but I'm so glad we made the trip. Just a tip though: make sure to make reservations. I'm glad I did, because the space is very small and stays busy."

I waited for 20 minutes and then a girl told me, ""fair warning but it's going to be 45 minutes or more for take out."" I said she could have told me that in first place before I waited for 20 minutes and got a huge attitude and told me, not in a nice way to have a good night. This is the first review I have ever written, I just couldn't believe how rude they were."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBX0tHcUJ3EAE,Piccata was not edible. Other food was ok. I do not recommended this restaurant.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRcVBpTk9nEAE,Hands down best vegan food in Omaha. If you are vegan vegetarian or a meat eater it doesn't matter this food is amazing and will fill you up. Get the Mac and Shews and you will not be disappointed!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRcjV5UXVRRRAB,"Amazing! This is our favorite restaurant in the area- for vegans and omnivores alike! Their seasonal menus bring about some of the best foods that I find myself craving but in a cruelty-free way! Plus, the menu staple of a variation on a Caesar salad (kale, grilled romaine) never disappoints. It is a small place so make reservations!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRMUpXdTlRRRAB,"Excellent food and Their Pina Colada Coconut Cream Pie is to die for, and the service is top notch,everyone there is really nice"

Food was still great, especially the Modern Burger."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3Mm9hc3V3RRAB,Wonderful variety of awesome vegan cuisine
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBMmFlVkRREAE,"I was so excited to try this place and left very disappointed. I came here with my family. The atmosphere was less than pleasant, it was very crammed and loud. My mom can't talk very loud at all due to a vocal condition and I couldn't hear a single thing she said basically the entire time. It left everyone a little frustrated. The appetizers were great, we had the buffalo wings and rangoon and I really enjoyed the wings, but then we had to wait over an hour for our food. I was not impressed by the main courses at all. I got the sweet potato enchilada and firstly was extremely confused as to how i was supposed to even eat it. When I started eating it, it was extremely bland. I wasn't a fan. The elote was SMOTHERED in the red chili powder, I mean absolutely smothered. It was ridiculous, you couldn't even see corn through the thick coat of chili powder...I ended up having to scrape it off to make it edible. My boyfriend got the bibimbap which was pretty good but nothing mindblowingly good. Mom and sister got the gyros which I didn't like at all, but they enjoyed. Sisters boyfriend got the burger which I thought was pretty good. All in all, the food was alright but nothing out of this world or stellar, especially for the price.

The service was pretty sub par too. We had a reservation at 8, apparently they close at 9 because we felt very rushed. You can't make us wait for an hour for our food, then rush us because you want to close! I barely took three bites by the time the waitress asked if we wanted boxes, I just said ""I have no idea if I will, yet"". It was a little annoying. Shortly after she asked if we wanted dessert, I was still barely halfway through my meal so...still...I have no idea if I will! All in all, I probably would not go back especially for that price point."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRbDdpQ09REAE,Sadly downgraded my rating. :( I hate to say it but the food hasn't been as good in the past 6-12 months (writing this in June 2017).
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRbDdhejBRRRAB,Great food and service!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3bFBTY2F3EAE,It's like eating in a cozy home with comfort food that is tasty and vegan.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNndjg2YVpBEAE,Absolutely amazing all vegan comfort food menu. Offerings change seasonally. Small place so reservations are recommended (though you can usually get a table without one if you don't mind a small wait). Excellent service to pair with the delicious and filling food!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3OS03NVNnEAE,It felt as if I were in a crowded barn. Atmosphere was not comfortable.  I could touch elbows with the people at the next table.  Food was okay at best.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBeXZidURBEAE,"Quite overrated - the food quality and quantity are very low compared to expectations - we are both vegetarian I do believe they rely on the fact that this is the only vegan restaurant in Omaha.Servers were okay but rather cold.
We left a big sum of money there and still felt hungry; frankly the only decent dish was the soup. We will not return and I do not recommend this restaurant to other vvegetarians/vegan people."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBOWM3bmFBEAE,"It was really good. I have never had such good vegan food. The cream soda was delicious but way over priced for a tiny thing. Also, I loved the rangoon but they were also overpriced. 10$ for 3 tiny things. But otherwise the burger and gyro were relish."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3NjhITVFREAE,"The best vegan recipes I've had - more like great food that just happens to be vegan. Every dish was amazing, and it was so nice to have an entire menu to select from without being concerned about non-vegan ingredients. Worth the cost, 100%!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRdk1tVk5REAE,"Hands down the best vegan restaurant, and top 3 best restaurants in general, I have been to. From the decor, to the staff, to the food, and even cocktails, everything was so amazing. 10/10 doctors recommend."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBaDhYV05REAE,"Best food in the area. The restaurant will make you wish you were vegan, even if you're a meat lover. Balanced, plant based meals that leave you satisfied and coming back for more."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNndThyT1J3EAE,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNROEtfQjR3RRAB,"Best vegan resteraurant in town!  Ok, it's the only vegan resteraurant in town...but it could compete with any place in Seattle or Portland.
I would recommend a reservation on Friday or Saturday.  The place is rather small and always packed on the weekends  (which I admit - I wasn't expecting)."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnMlB5aHRnRRAB,"If you need vegan, this is the place. I'm an omnivore, but I still thought the food was good. Very pricey though, especially if you don't need the veganness."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRM3B2LUVREAE,hell yeah
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBOWNUY2h3RRAB,Fantastic vegetarian restaurant.   Make a reservation beforehand.   You will not be disappointed in the food!

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3OU1iX2NREAE,The service and food was great! As a meat eater I still found a number of things on the menu that I was interested in and everything we had was delicious!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRc283N0V3EAE,"Had a wonderful kale salad and service was friendly. But the tables were a little too close for comfort and I feel the pricing is too high for Omaha. I realize the chef is outstanding, and ingredients were perfect freshness, but just sayin. However it was packed so if the market bears the pricing maybe it's ok."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBdE56Zlh3EAE,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRaHAta3lBRRAB,"I loved this place. First of all a Vegan place in Midwest., rarest thing to see. Second me being almost vegan(excluding dairy) loved the idea. Third seeing great reviews gave positive vibes. We went and ordered couple of dishes. The food is close to Indian food presented in American style. Place is small but didn't bother us much. Friendly service. One more thing every body said about is main course, however even the hot chocolate tasted great there. Price was a little higher end for me,but with the taste, yeah it is worth.."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBOWJ6WW5RRRAB,"I adore Modern Love, and I have since my very first time there. I have a dairy allergy, and this is the only restaurant in Omaha that I can eat at without worrying about accidentally being served dairy.

Back when they first opened they didn't serve alcohol, but now they have a limited selection of beers, wines, and cocktails. I was not impressed with the rosé I had with my dinner, but the food was incredible. I had the chana masala, and the portion was so generous that I got three whole meals out of it.

When we were packing up our leftovers, our two leftover seitan ""wings"" (totally delicious, BTW) fell on the floor. Our waitress noticed and the kitchen made up a whole new order for us to take home! I was really impressed with that little touch of kindness. And oh my goodness, the desserts...they are ridiculously good. ALL OF THEM. I've never had a bad experience or a bad meal here."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnNllXejVRRRAB,"This delicious haunt is not only appealing to those who are vegan, but anybody looking for a quality meal with locally sourced ingredients and a fresh approach to some classic dishes. My personal favorite are the huevos rancheros. The tofu has a wonderful texture and everything is extremely flavorful, including the cherry tomatoes that come on the side. You really can't go wrong at this place. Bring a friend, have a mimosa, and enjoy the great tunes on this awesome place's soundtrack."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBMFlTOTFRRRAB,Fantastic vegan restaurant I went to with a large group of friends.  The pot pie is to die for as are the desserts.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNncnAzVGJ3EAE,"Fantastic!  Friday, August 19, 2016 5pm reservations to celebrate my 65th and my daughter's birthday...arriving during a drenching summer rainstorm...great experience!

As a writer and transitioner to a more vegan way, as well as being quite plump, it was my first visit;  and I was so happily surprised with the unique intimate space, colorful...yet even more perky and colorful were the savory & satisfying dishes we chose.  Mine was the Seitan BBQ Cookout.  Visual and culinary art!

From beer, appetizers, entrees, to the most heavenly vegan-chocolate-cheesecake---no dairy cheese but even better.  The four of us had fun, ate like healthy royalty, and were spoiled by efficient and friendly service.
Reservations or takeout, this cozy and cheerful establishment is a real gem in Omaha. ♡"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURReDdmWG9RRRAB,"Breakfast was great, definitely recommend!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRb3RfbThBRRAB,Food was really good and the server was very nice.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBZ1lIU0hnEAE,"I wasn't really interested in the motivation behind this place. I love eating meat, dairy, eggs, and I feel okay towards vegetables. I laughed out loud when someone first proposed I eat here. I disliked the angle on this place and the clientele that I believed it was designed to attract. I don't have arm tattoos, listen to and brag about underground music, have out of the norm piercings, wear deep-Vs, ride a bike, have a beard, or wear plaid ever.

That being said, this restaurant is fantastic and worthy of all the praise it's been getting. The veggie burger is, as another review wrote, ""very scrumptious"".  It was nicely crusted on the outside and not a pureed mash in the middle and instead nicely textured. The curried falafel with rice pilaf was one of the best chickpea concoctions I've ever had. Mac & Shew? Don't think about it twice, just get it and be ready to woof it down. I can't say anything about drink, salad, and dessert quality.

The interior is lovingly decorated with light artwork and seasonal table decorations. The staff is attentive, friendly, and ready to explain any questions you might have, even if you have a lot of them since you don't know anything about cashew butter, seitan, tofu, or kale. Parking can be tight and the space inside is close, so there's no need to yell like you're in a sports bar.

If you're thinking that you're at least a little open-minded and less of a jerk than you actually are, give it a shot and hopefully you'll be overwhelmingly pleasantly surprised like I was. Way to go Modern Love!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURncFlqaFVnEAE,"Modern Love has fantastic food made from high-quality, local ingredients. Everything is fresh, homemade, and delicious. Oh, and it's vegan. That can just be a side note because it's amazingly tasty food that will appeal to omnivores as well as vegetarians of all types. The only downside of Modern Love is the tiny, cramped atmosphere. It is a lovely space, but much too small for a quiet dinner. Also, reservations are a must! I hope that they continue to grow and expand. I could then happily give 5 stars."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRcV9YN3Z3RRAB,Disappointing

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBdXNHeVNnEAE,"I and a friend ordered a Modern Cheeseburger that consisted of a lentil patty, smoky cashew cheddar, dill pickles, tomato, whole wheat bun, fatty fries, miso ketchup. When our plates arrived everything looked very tasty and then when I took a bite the lentil patty squeezed out of the sides and oozed out onto my finger's and fell onto my plate. I was expecting a patty that was firm and not soft. It also was a red color and looked like a raw hamburger. The flavor was very bland and the only thing that tasted some what eatable was the bun, but even it was too hard. It also had lettuce that was not fresh and was wilted. The potato's that came with it where cut to thick and even the root-beer drink we ordered didn't taste right. We had a pitcher of water at our table and there was no ice in it and it tasted like tap water. It is a small place and the seating was very limited and the tables were too close together. I told the lady that served us that the food didn't taste good and she told us she appreciated the feedback and would let the cook know. No apologize at all. I have been vegetarian for 15 yrs and I have ate countless veggie burgers and what was served to us was not a burger. We should have just left after the first bite of our food and not paid almost $50 dollars for the worst meal I have ever had. Both of us suffered from sick stomachs for several hours after eating part of the burgers. I was really expecting a good meal based on the reviews I read but had a completely opposite experience,"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBNUxqT093EAE,Can't rave enough about this place. I've been dreaming about the delicious food since I went. Follow them on Facebook for drool-worthy photos that will surely make you secure a reservation.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnLTRyd2VnEAE,"Fantastic food and excellent service. I highly recommend the wings. My wife owns most of the proprietor's cookbooks, and after we informed the hostess of this, we were delighted to have Isa Chandra Moskowitz deliver our dinner herself. We will definitely be dining here again!"

I arrived early.  At least 4 employees looked out the window and immediately looked away instead of offering  assistance."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnd2F5eXhnRRAB,"Amazing! We started with hummus, which is such a simple dish, yet Modern Love elevated it into a really wonderful appetizer with a few simple touches. For an entree I tried gnocchi; this is generally served as a heavier plate with sauce, like a pasta dish, but Modern Love's version was more like a delicious soup, comfort food with a fresh lemon taste - it was fantastic, I've never had anything like it, and I can't wait to return. My dinning partners had an Indian dish and their Mac and Cheese - both were superb. We split a ""cheesecake"" for desert and we're delighted. Modern Love has elevated vegan dining to more than a ""style"" of dining or a life choice - they stand on their own amongst the best restaurants in Omaha."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3dDhyVkNnEAE,"Let me start with I am not a vegan, nor a vegetarian. My wife made plans to meet others here and I went along not knowing what to expect.  What I found was one of the best tasting meals I have had in a long time. I had a bean/quinoa burger followed by a mojito cheesecake and both were out of this world! I will definitely be back."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnek5PYVlnEAE,"I am a born vegetarian. I travel for work quite frequently and I like to explore vegan/vegetarian restaurants while traveling so that I can eat healthy and also support these restaurants. While in Omaha, I was looking for such restaurants and the only one that I could find online was Modern Love.

To be honest, I wasn't sure how it would be and what to expect, but I still gave it a try. Finding the restaurant wasn't hard, the GPS was able to take me there easily. The restaurant is inside what looks like a small warehouse or car repair shop at an intersection. The parking could be a problem on a busy evening, as it is shared with another restaurant. The interior is modern and casual, but they have limited seating, so reservations are recommended.

I order the soup of the day, which was a creamy potato peas soup with fresh potato chips on top...absolutely delightful and tasty! I order the Island burger for the main course, which was very scrumptious! The fries were fresh made and every ingredient in the burger was bursting with freshness and flavor! What a treat to my taste buds!

I would go again and try other items on the menu. The fresh and healthy food should appeal to anyone, including carnivores. Highly recommended!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3cGNpd2RnEAE,It's so good I actually decided to write a review for something. 😱😱😱😱

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBd2FmOXpBRRAB,So much flavor. Best food ever. Wish I lived closer.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNReU83U21BRRAB,"Fantastic! We had a reservation and they were running a little behind (probably because no one wanted to leave), so they offered us a free drink on the house and Isa also offered to get us from a local bar connected to the same building. The food was fantastic, the atmosphere is refreshing, and the service was fantastic!"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBek9xUXpRRRAB,Very tasty vegan dinner. Worth driving just to Omaha for.
