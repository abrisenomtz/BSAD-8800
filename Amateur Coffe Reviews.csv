ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURIOThyRzlRRRAB,One of the best coffee spots I've visited and I will continue to go back
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURIbk5lNUlBEAE,"Finally! A coffee shop that roasts its own beans! At Amateur coffee, they focus on their coffee and not their aesthetic (although their culture and atmosphere is very inviting)! No plastic waste here: return your jar and get $2 off your next coffee! Best in Omaha! I like their Cold Brew!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ3bGJ6LUR3EAE,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ3bWJ1LVhBEAE,I enjoyed everything about this small coffee shop! The world needs more vegan coffee shops!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ3aU5fc2pBRRAB,One of my favorite coffee shops in Omaha! The coffee is amazing and they have special seasonal drink options; they also serve to go drinks in a glass jar that you are able to clean and bring back for a discount. I love the atmosphere and the service is always friendly!!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM3eExDUWxBRRAB,Cool local coffee shop with friendly staff
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqcXVmYmtRRRAB,"""This place has the best vegan coffee in town, hands down! Their donuts and pastries are simply amazing – every bite is a treat. The staff is super friendly and always make you feel welcome. The good vibes here are contagious, making it my go-to spot for a coffee fix or a sweet snack. Whether I'm hanging out with friends or just enjoying some quiet time, this café never disappoints. It's got everything I love in a coffee shop: great drinks, delicious food, and an atmosphere that feels like home."""
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNiaXU2YXJnRRAB,Kind staff and everything was delicious! Love that everything was vegan!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURydV9LZXBRRRAB,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURyeGMzWkVnEAE,"Best coffee shop in town! And they're fully vegan, which is very helpful for those with food intolerances & allergies. They are always willing to assist, great to talk to & the atmosphere of the shop is so relaxed."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNydzZXeEV3EAE,"I love this place, but I am sad they have chosen to replace their previous higher quality coconut milk with a cheaper version. I believe most of us who choose coconut milk do it for the health reasons, not because they want their milk to taste like a pina colada. :D That really strong, fake, sweet coconut flavor ruins everything. I hope you return back to an unsweetened brand like pacifica or so delicious cuz I really love stopping here, but I can't drink other milk and the coconut milk you have now is really bad.

I used to come in more frequently a year ago before it became out of the way for my commute. I guess $$$ doesn't always equal quality, but if it has a very strong coconut smell and taste, it's way too overpowering and the flavor of the latte is lost, so idk what the others you mentioned taste like but I'll try and stop in again in a few weeks!! Again, I LOVE your shop. I want to come back. Not many people use coconut milk and realize that THAT flavor is off putting.  Thank you!!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNybk1qRVNBEAE,I finally tried them after work one day after I had some friends rave about them once again. This is now my new favorite coffee shop. Best. Place. Ever.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURMNzlmb0l3EAE,"Lots of options. And the roaster was helpful, making a recommendations for what I prefer. The drink menu has great variety. And they appear to change seasonally.

Glad I stopped, while passing through town."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURMNzdiTGhBRRAB,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNMeXNhYVBREAE,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURUeTc2ZWpBRRAB,"Incredible coffee, amazing staff, cozy atmosphere. The lattes & lemongrass chai were top notch."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURqc2RyNzRnRRAB,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURqbVBXN2tBRRAB,"Fun atmosphere, great staff and loved that the drinks are served in reusable glass jars! Didn’t love the drinks themselves but overall loved the experience!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqaDc2UzVnRRAB,"This place has great coffee. I ordered to go and didn’t realize they charge for cups, they give you a mason jar for to go orders (which I frankly didnt want a small mason jar and think it’s a little much to charge a customer who is buying coffee a glass cup)
I also ordered the biscuit sandwich, and I found it to be dry and not tasteful. I only had two bites. Overall I recommend the coffee and bring your own cup! Pass on the food options."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqd04zNDBRRRAB,Amateur is my second favorite coffee shop in Omaha! Their vegan mission and sustainable coffee jar program are radical in the best way possible. The staff are very kind and courteous and the general cohesiveness of this place is very organized and well thought out.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREdTc2RVF3EAE,"What’s not to love about this place?
Vegan friendly and environmentally friendly??
Yes please!
Old picture but the coffee is STILL amazing!
Wish I was able to get there more often."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREMi1lVWRBEAE,"My must-have every time I'm in Omaha ❤️ Went for the 100% vegan menu, stayed for the sustainable practices. I visit from out of town & keep the jars in my car to return the next time I'm there!
The ever-changing seasonal menu makes it so you HAVE to go and try what's new. Never disappointed whether I've stayed for a coffee, ordered to-go, or had it delivered."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREMl9PTzhBRRAB,"Every good coffeeshop embraces its quirks. Amateur is the definition of a local coffeeshop that’s embraced who they are. Good coffee, environmentally-friendly, and a unique “city feel.” The kind of shop that I wish I didn’t live 50 miles away from :)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREb18ySlJBEAE,I absolutely love this place.  They have a glass jar program as well for to-go orders which are more environmentally friendly.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREOVl5N3BRRRAB,Slow service. They don't have disposable cups for any takeout drinks and forced to pay $2 for each takeout drink jar that they put our drinks in. The jars are returnable but we are from our of town and were in a hurry and wanted something good. The lattes we got were not that good and not worth the $10 (drink and $2 jar) for each drink. I would have preferred a Casey's coffee or cappuccino over this place and it's quicker and cheaper.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREaXFIdmxRRRAB,"Latte was smooth and delicious.  Small space with bar stool type seating, but I loved the atmosphere and the barista was super helpful and friendly.  Will definitely return."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREdEtXYlJ3EAE,My family and I stopped in for coffee and baked treats and our visit did not disappoint! Amateur Coffee has some nice daily brews that you can also purchase the beans to take home while also offering inventive lattes and other caffeinated beverages to charge you up! The baristas were super helpful and attentive during our visit. I will definitely be back for more good coffee and to take some beans home this time!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURENU1Tc2l3RRAB,I’m from out of state and when I tell you I think about this coffee every day
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEcG9yQXZnRRAB,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ5eVlqR3NRRRAB,Very nice place!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ5d2Jfa1FREAE,"The worst part of living really far out west now is that Amateur is no longer down the street from me. I’m definitely missing that iced pistachio latte I used to get all the time. As a barista, I’m usually so particular about my coffee orders, but at Amateur I know I can order anything off of the menu, no modifications needed, and the drinks will be amazing every time!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ5cU5pRnhBRRAB,"The five stars for ""food"" are actually for the coffee. We only had a scone and it was just fine but not a five-star scone. But back to the coffee: it's a well roasted, well made brew as one would expect to find at a higher end coffee place such as this. What distinguishes Amateur is its excellent service and its refusal to use disposable cups. While the deposit jars aren't perhaps the most convenient thing in the world, frankly we all need a bit less convenience and more conscience if we don't want to destroy every last bit of joy on this planet. I applaud businesses such as Amateur that hold to this notion and do a great job making it work. Those jars are remarkably practical!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM5djlQQml3RRAB,"I got the 2 scones and they’re both delicious, even Larry David would love these! I got a cappuccino and it was absolutely amazing. Also they got really good coffee beans and they roast everything there."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM5bEtTZWVBEAE,Heaven for Vegans. Even the coffee is Vegan.  Great Swag!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURkMGVxdXl3RRAB,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURkZ1BLLVVnEAE,"I absolutely loved this place! The space is cozy and charming, everyone was so welcoming and patient. As a vegan, I was so excited to try some things off their menu. The waffles are incredible! And I asked for a decaf oat milk cappuccino, and the owner made it and it was delicious. Vegan places are so wonderful to have in our community. For those choosing to be vegan for environmental reasons, animal rights and/or health/ diet reasons, having a welcoming and delicious spot to get a fantastic cup of coffee and superb food makes a huge difference. And if your not vegan, this is a fantastic place to enjoy some great coffee, a scone, and hang out with a friend or read a book. Plus their merchandise is awesome. I bought the cutest beanie there!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR0cjZpcklnEAE,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNOaklMZ0N3EAE,"Amazing coffee and friendly people! This is some of my favorite coffee in Omaha. The coffee roasts are intentional and compliment the bean very well, and the drinks are creative and masterfully executed. The latte art for the dine-in lattes is beautiful. The non-coffee drinks are good too - I recently tried the Golden Mylk Turmeric Latté and it was delicious!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQxcy1fSVdREAE,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQxelBTYXJRRRAB,"Absolutely bananas how good the coffee is, complex beans, expertly crafted. Love the touch of serving to-go in the glass jars. A1! Highly recommend!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURWaDZQX0J3EAE,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNWdGRLQy1nRRAB,"This place is the bomb. They know how to do espresso correctly, that is, served with sparkling water. The breakfast sandwich was tasty, and the pastries were delectable - even the baked doughnut lived up the the expectations of a doughnut. (Extra props for the espresso - I've never been to an American coffee shop that served it the way I've seen it done in Europe.)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNsal9idjh3RRAB,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNsNmJlakRREAE,"Service was great,"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNsenFtRUxREAE,Great find! Special place with great coffee
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURGaC1LUzRBRRAB,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNGNFpyZFZBEAE,"The best coffee in Omaha for consumers, animals, and the environment.
We ordered the spirulina & elderflower latte, jade matcha & rose latte which were very delicious and comforting. The chicken on their chicken and waffles has the texture and flavor of fried chicken, but made with mushrooms. It paired nicely with their coconut whipped cream. The breakfast sandwich has a nice tofu egg. The maple syrup from the chicken and waffles went nicely with the sandwich. They also offer complementary hot sauce.
They have a gender neutral restroom.
They have their own line of roasted coffee and cute merchandise.
The staff was very friendly and personable."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ1cWRlUkF3EAE,vegan slay
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM1Z18tdG9RRRAB,"Cute little vegan shop. The staff were super friendly and helpful! I had their breakfast sandwich, gluten free chocolate frosted brownie and a pumpkin spice latte with their homemade coconut whipped cream. The service was quick. And the food was 9/10! I didn’t think I’d like tofu egg but it felt like I was eating the real thing. 10/10 would recommend checking this place out if you like pastries and good coffee."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM1NXJqMDhnRRAB,Have nothing but good things to say! Their seasonal menu items are so fun. My favorites are the Nut Butter + Jelly Shaken Espresso (pictured) and Birthday Cake Latte. The staff members are great. Love that the shop is 100% vegan. The reusable glass jars are genius and the stickers on the lids are precious. It is a pleasure supporting this local biz!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURaOV92blFnEAE,"This place has some of the best coffee I’ve ever had. Highly recommend the pistachio syrup, tastes like it’s made in house and it’s amazing. It’s a bit pricey, but worth it for the sustainability of the reusable jars they offer, the fact that their menu is all vegan, and the taste. The staff was also really kind and helpful. It is a very small space, though, a bit hard to maneuver around. Not super disability aid friendly."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURaazlUR1JnEAE,This is my favorite coffee in the world! I drive hours just to get a cup fr fr!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNadUxEZ2xnRRAB,"Cosy place with fantastic food. Chick and waffle was amazing. Coffee is amazing, wish there were more locations. Must visit!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURaNkxUSEx3EAE,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURaa0szc0dnEAE,"Best coffee in Omaha, hands down! Visited other coffee shops locally and there is no compare. They do latte art here and roast their coffee onsite. Highly recommend!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNaczUzMUVnEAE,"Favorite coffee shop. Most lattes taste the same wherever you get them, but not so at Amateur. Amazing seasonal drinks, outstanding food, and a super friendly, chill staff. It's a must-visit anytime I find myself in Omaha."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNaOHNxX2dBRRAB,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNadU5MMjZBRRAB,My favorite venue in Omaha. Warm and welcoming hidden gem worth stopping in. Reusable jars instead of paper cups. Vegan.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURwejZqZlN3EAE,If you want a solid coffee made by some pros stop in. Their glass jar program is a smart idea and doing well to keep our environment clean! Loved the drinks we got.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURwNTZyaXVBRRAB,"I live out of town and visit each time I come into town. It’s my fav spot. Cute spot, and you can’t go wrong with pistachio iced latte. Sad they don’t have chia seed pudding anymore, and also sad they won’t allow a little extra oat milk when you order an extra shot of espresso in your latte (drank a little and it was extra bitter obviously, so requested a little extra oat milk and was denied.)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURwZzlDemtRRRAB,"The brown sugar shaken espresso was exactly the coffee drink I have been wanting. I love that they have a jar, reuse program and no throwaway cups."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURwbnJ2dFJREAE,Super cool coffee shop if you're a local this should be your go-to! They serve in reusable glass containers. All about the eco-friendly.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURwa3VMM3p3RRAB,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURwbk51dENBEAE,Coffee was delicious.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURwMEkyWnp3RRAB,Lovely service
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNKZy1fMUZnEAE,"The best place for coffee, even a little better than Starbucks! 
…
This was my favorite coffee place, and I was a regular, it helps when I work weekends overnights that it’s opens at 7am, but lately all the employees been acting very oddly towards me. Let’s just say I will learn to make it home."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNwMmVUd3J3RRAB,We got a cappachino and toasted marshmallow chai and they were both delicious! I also got the double chocolate sprinkle donut and it was satisfying without being too overly sweet. The energy and atmosphere was perfect for a chill Sunday morning.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNwMmZER21RRRAB,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNwMHR5dEJ3EAE,"Fantastic coffee, tea and food. 2nd only to the service. I'm so glad we went for a light lunch of waffles and coffee. Because breakfast food is better at lunch."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNwbU9TcnJnRRAB,"Queer, Vegan, and supports local artists. What more could you ask for!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURKaThfT3VRRRAB,"I visit Omaha from Denver often and this is always my first stop.

I absolutely love the vibe, concept, and goodies!

I’ve accrued an amazing collection of queer & poly positive artwork and have devoured countless vegan baked yummies and bevvies. The staff is lovely and welcoming.

Thank you for providing a safe, inclusive, inviting and delicious space! ☕️"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURKODRHRFN3EAE,"The entire experience could not get any better. Absolutely beautiful shop, decor is gorgeous, lighting is wonderful, even the floor is so beautiful. The baristas are all so kind and inviting. My drink was *chefs kiss*. I also got a chocolate donut and a blueberry scone and they were SOOOOOO yummy. Will be back. (Probably tomorrow lol)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURKeGVuSDV3RRAB,Amazing coffee and easily the most eco-friendly coffee shop in Omaha.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNKblo2XzJBRRAB,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNKbllDWW53RRAB,"Ethical, colorful vibes. The baristas are just the right amount of mean to me. The (dirty) Golden Milk is an absolute fave. 10/10."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNKaXRPS2ZREAE,"I am absolutely obsessed with this vegan coffee shop. I was traveling through town and found it on Happy Cow when looking for vegan breakfast items. If you are vegan/plant based, love zero waste, and love super tasty coffee, donuts, scones, waffles, and other breakfast yums, this place is a must! My partner got the shaken brown sugar espresso, and I got the cold brew. We also got a waffle, donut, and breakfast sandwich. All were so incredibly tasty. Please support this fantastic business!!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNKMkkzMXFRRRAB,Great coffee. Love their mission.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR4bThhY3B3RRAB,"Adorable, hidden gem of a coffee shop! 100% vegan friendly service in a fun atmosphere. Drink options were so unique and so fun. Sustainability focused too!"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR4LWREX1hBEAE,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR4bks2bmZREAE,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4bTgzR0lnEAE,I stopped here on my way through town and the staff was so friendly! They gave some great tips on vegan places to eat and things to do in the area. I will definitely be coming back the next time I'm in the area!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4bWFUQlRBEAE,Wonderful atmosphere! Delicious coffee and breakfast! Highly recommended this gem
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNmJEak1REAE,"I love this place! The cortado was delicious, the espresso was fresh, the brown sugar shaken espresso was an absolute treat, and the breakfast sandwich was top tier. A great experience all around, worth stopping for if you’re passing through Omaha."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNk1pVEdBEAE,"Little place but unexpectedly good. It’s neat looking inside. The people were friendly. The  coffee shop is fully vegan. Their reusable glass jars are a nice idea in preventing waste! Also, highly recommend the pistachio late & sugar mama!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScU5HOXZnRRAB,"Love this vegan coffee shop! Every drink, tea, and pastry I’ve tried at amateur has been absolutely lovely and my tummy doesn’t feel horrible after having their food & drinks!! Personally take friends and family here when they visit from out of town - would recommend you try out. (Have taken kids here too and they liked the hot chocolates even more than the chains & didn’t even realize it was vegan until I explained)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbHF2dFB3EAE,Cute little vegan coffee shop with friendly workers and a couple food options for breakfast or a snack. I had a cake donut and waffle and both were delicious (and soy free which is a rarity in vegan places!)
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodGZfWHdBRRAB,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMmFQYTNRRRAB,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURobG9lNTdRRRAB,Jasmyn is an amazing business owner! She’s doing great things and going places! Great job with your lovely shop
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURobHJUMjFRRRAB,"I really loved the vibe. not a group outing kind of place, but great to bring a friend or 2, or just to escape the office for a bit. highly recommend for people with lots of allergies or dietary restrictions. as a gluten-free person, I LOVE that they had more than one measly option, and my options were good!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoZ082aHdRRRAB,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoeC1TVU1nEAE,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNobnVLM1JBEAE,"I absolutely love this coffee shop! It has a cozy and welcoming atmosphere and the staff were friendly and patient. I had a latte and myboyfriend had the cold brew,both drinks were delicious. They are vegan and follow sustainable practices, I will  definitely be back next time I am in town."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNocG9DVlV3EAE,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCdmRDemxRRRAB,This is a great little vegan coffee shop.  I'm not personally vegan but thoroughly enjoyed my coffee and experience. The barista was very friendly/helpful and the atmosphere was nice.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCdHAyeU9REAE,"Apart from Blue Bottle, I’d say that Amateur makes the greatest latte I’ve ever had. So smooth, so flavorful, so delicious. The price point is a little high, but then it makes me truly savor my cup/jar whenever I do stop by. Love sitting out back with a view of the beautiful cathedral, too."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtdTYyOU93EAE,Bad service. Incredibly slow. Workers oblivious.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtc3Vfc253RRAB,Lovely small coffee shop. Delicious vegan drinks and cozy atmosphere.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtak9QamlBRRAB,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtc2U3OUdREAE,"Always love coming in and getting their coffee! Sometimes, service can be slow if you go during a rush, but it's always worth it!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtM0pEa2p3RRAB,Tastes great and amazing ambience
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtbEpxRUVnEAE,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNteTUtRU53EAE,One of my favorite places in Omaha. Cozy little shop with delicious food and drinks. Vegan friendly! ❤️
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtOE9PQTd3RRAB,I love that this coffee shop is vegan and zero waste. The coffee is delicious and it is such a cute local coffee shop!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlNnVpd2tRRRAB,"Best coffee I’ve ever had! Great environment, nice staff! Love love love! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlcUlTUGZnEAE,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlbTQyc3BBRRAB,"Good food, coffee, and a good experience too. Vegan without being pretentious."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlb19UQ0d3EAE,I loved that their standard milk is oat! They were super helpful with getting power to the outside tables. Only downside was that they don't have coconut milk as an option.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQybnUyNDhRRRAB,"Visited from Lawrence Kansas and the experience was one of our weekend vacation highlights. Best coffee and WHAT A MENU! Jealous that there isn't a location in Lawrence. Very happy and very satisfying experience. Most definitely one of the best places that Omaha has to offer.

Update. Just as amazing and delicious as last time we went on vacation to Omaha! Looking forward to updating this review for many more years to come! Thank you amateur coffee for making such good and enjoyable coffee!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlOXF6SlJBEAE,"Okay, I was nervous about vegan options like oatmilk, so I did something I never do and drank my coffee black. It was delicious. Got brave and added oatmilk-also delicious. Partner got a brown sugar shaken espresso and we both said it was the best one we’ve ever had."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1b09hVWJBEAE,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlc09tU2F3EAE,"I recently moved to Omaha, and this is one of the first places that I visited. It was very friendly and inviting. I love the idea of the reusable glass jars to drastically reduce the waste that a normal coffee shop would produce. May not work great for you if you're on the go and never plan to return, but you can take some comfort in the fact that you've reduced your negative environmental impact.

I only order black coffee, but there is always more than one brew available, and the prices are comparable to any other coffee shop. Their regular coffee is vastly better than whatever Starbucks uses."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlZ1BURTBnRRAB,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1dDd1UDZnRRAB,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1cWNYQ2p3RRAB,"Great little place - my new favorite coffee shop in Omaha. Creative way to cup a cappuccino, but the jar is too narrow to maintain the consistency. Decent idea for a latte or non-milky drink though."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1bVBuUHZRRRAB,"Awesome vegan food and drinks.

Had iced chai latte and a breakfast sandwich. Refreshing, light, tasty chai. The sandwich was hot and probably the best vegan breakfast food I've had.

Wish I lived in Omaha to have it more often!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1M1lqOVB3EAE,unlike any others taste
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1eWRQcjRRRRAB,"Been trying out a few coffee shops in the area and this by far is the best place we've found. There are menu items you will not see anywhere else. I would highly recommend the turmeric latte dirty hot or ice, never had anything like it and it's the best. This place also is all vegan which was a delightful surprise."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1dHAtNmpRRRAB,"The summer menu is so interesting, hard to choose.  The pineapple espresso drink sounded weird, but was soooo tasty; the flavors worked so well together.  Thanks guys!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1NnNUY1N3EAE,"Good coffee shop for alternative diets, they have vegan drinks. Knowledgeable staff and a simple homey vibe."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1N09UcDhnRRAB,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1dE1LenVnRRAB,"The drinks are really tasty but overpriced especially considering they don’t pay their employees well. The food is just meh and wayyyy to expensive for how small and bland it taste. Also, the sandwiches never seem to be heated properly beware of biting into a breakfast sandwich that’s ice cold in the middle."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1bEsyU3hRRRAB,This place has always been overpriced but now they can’t even staff it. Turns out $12 for a latte in a glass jar means they’re paying their employees $10 to make like 20-50 of these an hour. No wonder everyone walked out.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1bEpINkdnEAE,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1bElqMm93RRAB,"Overpriced coffee & food. Breakfast sandwiches are always inconsistently heated up. Waffle is tiny, you will need more food. Not an accessible building. Seemingly always short staffed which feels like a testament to the ownership."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1NU9Pb2hnRRAB,"I’ve had such friendly and attentive experiences with staff in the past. This was one of my husband and I’s favorite spots to grab coffee because we used to live down the street. It made us feel safe that they offered curbside pickup especially during the beginning of the pandemic. However, it makes us sad to see that the entire staff has been fired or walked out due to poor management and ownership. It’s concerning to see a small, local business behave so heartlessly, especially during such difficult times. Until the owners can take some form of public accountability we will be supporting other local businesses and we encourage others to do the same."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1eE5pdERnEAE,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPbV9TNjJ3RRAB,I would recommend ordering 30 minutes earlier than you were planning as it's very busy. But other than that it's amazing and the breakfast sandwiches are to die for.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPOF8zdkJnEAE,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPODdLcVBREAE,"The best donuts ever and great coffee too. Support vegan, small businesses."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPLWRPUHNRRRAB,"Great Coffee, nice place"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPenA2T1VBEAE,"Cappuccino was lukewarm, foam art needs work. Cleanliness needs work.  Very hipster and eclectic."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPMjdXdzhBRRAB,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPZ1pHanVnRRAB,Was visiting Omaha for a few days and had to check out this vegan coffee shop. I’ve heard great things about it so wanted to check it out for myself and am so glad I did! I love that everything is 100% vegan and they don’t use plastic. They offer glass jars for to-go drinks and if you bring it back you get money off your order which is awesome. Their default milk is Oatly and the lattes are SO good! They have so many fun specialty lattes that it is so hard to choose what to get! The donuts!! Omg! So yummy! The breakfast sandwich is delicious too. I went back every morning that I was in Omaha. Definitely check it out!!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPanZpUnpBRRAB,"My wife and I drove up from Lincoln to enjoy breakfast.  Amateur Coffee truly lives up to its name.  The items were overpriced with no unique quality and service was profoundly lacking hospitality.  The atmosphere was tense due to the staff going back and forth on a large order being worked, and also down a staff member.  We later found that out after paying and waiting 30 minutes. The reviews and hype are possibly from locals who do don't know better when it comes to service and freshly made food.  The food tasted rubbery and microwaved.  The waffle was the only freshly made item, but, from a dirty waffle maker cooked in front of us.

An Americano, a pinnaple expresso, vegan chicken with waffle, and a breakfast sandwich with $5 tip for $40 dollars - yikes.  This local vegan shop is what gives the concept of vegan food as undesirable. If the shop only focused on coffee and no food, this could potentially help the  Amateur Coffee shop mission statement."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPNHFpOUJREAE,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPZ3Z2cU9BEAE,Literally was selling ten dollar lattes in jars
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyejl2Y1VBEAE,The employees are so nice and attentive. They make the best coffees! Thanks for a great experience!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyMllMU0tBEAE,"This little place is adorable! I had a lot of boring work to do (emails--so many emails) and decided to head to Amateur coffee for a latte and a nicer atmosphere than my hotel room. I am so glad I did. I ended up staying for nearly four hours, and tried their riff on the London Fog, an iced Brown Sugar Espresso drink, a tofu quiche, and a blueberry scone. Everything was amazing and the workers were all very kind. Plus, I finished all my work! Will certainly be back."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyMGZUYlBnEAE,"The name belies their coffee! It's great, the staff is friendly and not stuffy. I love their commitment to being eco conscious. I also love their coffee bags with beautiful imagery and sometimes funny names!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyd2RXVE9nEAE,Such a cool place! We had excellent coffee & quiches. Everyone is so nice! Thanks for a great experience!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyd1ptcmZ3EAE,Came in spent 30 dollars on coffee supporting our local business. I have been here plenty of times btw. I always get the same things chai tea latte no espresso. Well today someone newer took the order and they came to talk to me about the order and needed to up charge me 2 dollars for milk. Ok get it but then I heard the manager I think discuss with the new person that they should be clarifying to make sure things are rang in correctly. So it wasn’t me fault and I still had to pay the difference? Like customer service is key and this mistake was on the staff not myself so why am I being up charged? Most places would take their loss since it was a team issue not a customer issue. Not super excited today about this experience.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyanVHZC1nRRAB,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyN01EWF9nRRAB,Great drinks and the people were amazing!! I got their hot chocolate and it was crazy :) thank you guys for making us feel so welcome on our last morning in the area!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQycXJUaGZREAE,i love this place be sure to return your glass for a discount
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyMG9lSGp3RRAB,"Love their vegan recipes, Oatmilk is their standard milk option. All of their art & branding is super cute and colorful. The staff is friendly, efficient, and knowledgeable- they look like they enjoy their job! They also have a reusable/returnable to-go, glass container program which I love because it incentivizes re-using/sustainability, offers a unique and branded look, and benefits customers (giving them money off their next order) when they bring it back!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyMG9lNXNnRRAB,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyMEltRU9BEAE,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMydV9TSzVnRRAB,"This place is one-of-a-kind! And I’m so glad I live near enough to go a couple times a month. While their drinks are pricier than other places, you feel good knowing they are taking a lot of care to make them vegan and to be eco-friendly (for example, using glass jars). The quality of the drinks is superior too. My favorite is the pistachio latte. I’ve tried a few around town but this one is the best! Something to know is there really isn’t anywhere to sit inside, so it’s more of a to-go place (though they do have a few seats outside in the back)."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyMi1mNllREAE,"Love this cute coffee shop! All of their food options are vegan, and I know they use oat milk for many of their drinks! There is a cute little patio in the back which is great for seating! All of the baristas I have ever had have been very friendly and engaging, also quite knowledgeable about the menu as well. I also love how they are sustainable with their glass jar program! Definitely one of my favorite coffee shops in Omaha! They have some cool merch as well"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyb2VYejhnRRAB,"I absolutely adore this place. My husband and I stopped in for gluten free/vegan breakfast sandwiches over our honeymoon a month ago. Today my husband just so happened to be in Omaha for work so I requested he stop by and bring me home an iced banana split latte in a glass jar and pick up a couple of bags of their coffee (truly amazing). We live in Lincoln, which is just a hop skip and a jump away but I still wish it were closer so I could frequent it more often!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyenEtN1J3EAE,"The cutest little place! The coffee was great! I have yet to try their black coffee (which is a true test) but the lattes are great!

I love the fact that they use glass bottles!! If you bring it back they give you $1 off your next order 

My favorite thing about this place is that their default milk is Oatmilk instead of cow milk! Not to mention everything the serve is vegan which is pretty cool for anyone following that lifestyle.

The staff was so amazing and friendly! If you haven’t tried Amateur out yet, don’t you think it’s time?!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMya3FtdlRBEAE,

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXX1l2SkhBEAE,It is a cozy coffee shop /roaster.  All of staff there are very friendly and professional. It was very enjoyable watching the  barista works. She is so good multitasking.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXX2Q2aXNRRRAB,This place is about being sustainable
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXamJ2OVhnEAE,Celiac and vegan friendly! This is the most amazing coffee shop in omaha! Their coffee is amazing along with the pastries which are gluten free! Awesome and knowledgeable staff!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXd3FIYzVRRRAB,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXMThDVzdnRRAB,So cute & the coffee and treats were delicious.

Update: it's still good!"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXX3RyWUtnEAE,Extra stars for zero plastic.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXNnNXOWVnEAE,One of the coolest coffee shops I have visited.  Limited seating.  I had a waffle and a latte and both were fantastic.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXOFAzZ19nRRAB,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtaC16bF9nRRAB,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtMmFIMEdBEAE,Used to come all the time but moved pretty far out west. I finally made it back out today and it was definitely worth the trip. Thanks for the always amazing service and delicious coffee
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtc2FiRlR3EAE,"Ecofriendly: Yes
Dairy-free coffee that actually tastes great: Yes
Cool ppl roasting coffee 15 feet away: Yes

Latte was great and the staff were chill. Plus, the business model aligns with some of my personal ethics. The low-waste model rewards customers who reuse their (cleaned) jars instead of contributing to the mountain of plastic we use on a daily basis.

I'm curious if I could also bring in my own container for freshly roasted beans.

My *only* complaint is the cortado can't really be taken to go. Good thing there are a ton of other options to try out!

Give this place a go if you're in the area!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtek9tU1R3EAE,I come here every Saturday. They have the best selection of seasonal drinks and vegan yummies from sweet magnolias.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNteS1MZWxBRRAB,"Fantastic, the barista was willing to let me taste test the two drip options for the day. Based on the very small containers of each option, you can tell that they care about dialing in fresh drip and understand that brewing a gigantic batch is not the way to go. Presentation in a glass container is also a unique touch. Loved all aspects."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtbHFMYkVnEAE,Some of the best coffee I’ve ever had. I love the glass cups the coffee comes in.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtM09QbFVREAE,I haven’t lived in Omaha for years but whenever I visit family I make sure to come here for the best cup of _a_n_y_t_h_i_n_g_! Today I had the golden milk latte 5/5 and always great service and very cozy spot!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtMUxxR2JREAE,"Crafted coffee with intentional community. This busy little coffee shop feels warm from the moment you step inside.
The staff is knowledgeable and friendly.
Their seasonal lattes feel luxurious at a reasonable price.
An amazing place to feel at home."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHZzkzWXRBRRAB,My favorite spot for coffee in Omaha.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHbGJXWG9RRRAB,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHdlBfTUhREAE,"Neat, eclectic coffee shop nestled in the heart of Joslyn Castle. Their glass bottle program is very unique, and I hope they intend to keep it for the long haul. Their cold brew is very good, their pastries are good as well (with gluten free in mind). It is fairly tight quarters, and may not be the spot to catch up on work, but could be a good place to catch up with friends and strike conversation with wrap around bar seating. Overall, I'd say take a gander, grab some coffee, and enjoy the atmosphere."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2bDV6MGxnRRAB,"Wonderful service and delicious drinks! I also appreciate the gluten free foods that are offered, never had a reaction."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2NjlYR2N3EAE,"We came to Omaha for a coffee crawl, and this is hands down the best! They give you an adorable glass jar for to go orders and the latte's are unique, vegan, and not too sweet."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2eHEtRmpBRRAB,"This place was sooo cute. I love giving my business to an all vegan spot, heck yeah. Super cool reusable jar discount program (I stopped in on a road trip, so I won't get the advantage of the discount but I still use my jar all the time!) I think my only teeny tiny complaint would be that the breakfast burritos were small. Very very small. But so oily that they felt more filling than something that small normally would. The pastries were incredible!! The coffee was delicious. But the burrito was probably a lil overpriced for what you get"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2LXRxWllBEAE,I got a dirty pumpkin chai latte that tasted like christmas at an old lady’s house. What more people?

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2bzg2cmNBEAE,"Stumbled upon this cute coffee shop on our way to the bakery around the corner, and so glad we did! I got the London Fog and it was delicious. Wife got a salted caramel latte, and said it was the best in town by far. Our favorite thing is definitely that the drinks are served in glass jars (with coozies so you don’t burn your hands) that you can bring back and get $1 off next time. We’ve been trying to reduce our plastic use so this made us very happy. We will be back again for sure!!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2bnRqcHN3RRAB,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2bUpxMlFnEAE,"Thanks, Shelby.

The cold, feeling of a huge unwelcoming burden made it really nice for us to experience.

I hope you’re not that self righteous, annoyed, pretentious, and cold hearted o the other customers you encounter.

Such a shame and truly disappointing.

Oh and there was another lady in the back.  Thanks for not caring as well. Wish could get your name but you were too busy avoiding distance as well."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhejQ3c0NREAE,New favorite coffee shop. I love that they are zero waste and vegan. The carry-out jar system is really cool. Great flavors and tons of variety.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhdmZmRU5BEAE,Lubit
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhdGFHeE53EAE,"Their lattes are ridiculously good. I'm not vegan and just tried this place, their oat milk pistachio latte was probably my favorite coffee drink I've ever had."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhM1BTaDlnRRAB,"Very, very pleased my friends and I found this place! I had a delicious latte with Oatly milk and a gluten free raspberry coffee cake for breakfast, and grabbed another piece of coffee cake to take home. The staff were very friendly, and the space was small but fun. Definitely will go back the next time I’m in town!"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxaDdUeUhREAE,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxMzk3WFlnEAE,"Hands down the best coffee in Omaha. Was on the hunt for something decent (not expecting much in the midwest..) and I was blown away by the variety of the lattes and the sheer deliciousness of the blend. The baristas know their stuff and their coffee shows it. Then, learning that the whole place was vegan was just icing on the (vegan) cake. I had to get dos pastries just for the sake of options. And then! With the reusable jars, It was like cherries on top of the icing? (This analogy is running dry...). Really have a hard time finding something bad about this place. 100% willing to drive across town for this coffee."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxdGMycmRREAE,"Holy crow this coffee is goooood! Traveling from Flagstaff, AZ to RI and I’m writing this review on the last leg of our trip, from Lebanon, PA to RI and hands down this was the BEST coffee. I don’t think I’ve had coffee this good in Phoenix (where I live) ever. SUPER impressed. I got a hot latte with Rose & Pistachio - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! Omg ❤️

The chicken and waffles was excellent, and the brownie was fabulous too!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxdm9QSllnEAE,Love all the fun coffee “cocktails”! Super unique
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxbXVxdVJREAE,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxNnZXVVdREAE,I had zero expectations walking in here because we just randomly came across it and wanted coffee. I am so glad we walked in here. First of its a great looking place and with amazing and friendly staff. They also put their coffee into jars so you are encouraged to reuse and recycle and honestly I can't think of a better idea. They are doing great things here and I can't wait to go back.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxbkpqcWNnEAE,"Fantastic espresso, super nice staff, inside was really clean, great decor, fun merch, parking behind building btw"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxbTdYUC13RRAB,"This is NOT your “run of the mill” coffee shop! This place (in my opinion) needs to be featured on travel networks in the “Places You MUST visit or you’ll be kicking yourself if you don’t” category for Omaha. Their coffee is smooth and delicious. Like drinking velvet! The lattes aren’t too sweet and come in a variety of flavors. Don’t know what to get? They are great at helping and very knowledgeable. Seriously my favorite coffee house in the country, so far!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxeS1tVy1nRRAB,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxemRQNTVBRRAB,"I can’t tell you we drove to Omaha from Denver for the coffee. Or even for this coffee place. But I can say that I’m glad a vague and random search for “vegan coffee” pulled this place up. The coffee drinks were innovative and delicious (pistachio coffee!!!) and I didn’t even end up getting a coffee and instead got a riff on a London Fog, and it was spectacular. If you live in Omaha Clint yourself lucky to have this wonderful place at your disposal. If you’re just passing through go here without hesitation. We have to drive back and Omaha is enroute so we’ll be back. Happily!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxOGFmamtRRRAB,Super delicious waffles and good coffee.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxNnZUYnhRRRAB,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxdkt2Q0J3EAE,Very pleased with their variety of non coffee drinks! The staff have been absolutely wonderful. Overall a great and welcoming environment
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLcGMzd3hBRRAB,"Great coffee! I’ve returned two glass jars, when I do online pickup. (I do online pickup so often that I already know some the employees names) I mentioned this to the employe this morning who I don’t think has helped me before because I went inside today to order & was hoping to get a discount. And he just repeated how the process works, wasn’t very helpful. So I guess there’s no point in returning a jar since you don’t receive a discount."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLc2VuUjZBRRAB,"I just stumbled upon this place while driving so I pulled over to try it and was SO impressed. Such a cool place and really good price for a small, local business with good quality product. Plus I love the reusable jar to-go cups. 10/10 recommend"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLMm9XbzZnRRAB,A cute place with a good vibe. The baked goods were great but the coffee was just mediocre. I think the milk substitute didn't sit well with me. Still a great place to go and grab a treat.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLakxmSUJREAE,Our last stop before heading back to Kansas City. It is definitely somewhere to come back to. The coffee was excellent. We really appreciate their use of reusable coffee cups. This concept would do very well back home.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLME9yZ3JnRRAB,Cool to-go ware for a quality cup of coffee. Also enjoyed the shortbread and chia pudding I got on a quick stop for an early morning drive through Omaha. Definitely don't miss this spot.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5em9UYkV3EAE,I love that everything is vegan! I love the vibe. They havr pastries from Magnolia that are to die for. Reusable jars are fantastic too!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5LW92Y2J3EAE,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5dUo3anB3RRAB,Love the Rose latte!  Friendly staff great pastries.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5eU1ISjZRRRAB,So thankful to have a vegan coffeeshop in Omaha! Our favorite is the iced pistachio oat milk latte. Cutest little interior. Definitely buy a bag of beans for brewing at home.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5NS1LNmh3RRAB,"Amateur has the only Rose Cardamom Latte in town, and its delicious! This is my favorite coffee in Omaha. The subtle sweetness of the rose is perfectly aromatic, and the cardamom gives the latte a little kick on top of the espresso flavor. Their pastries are delicious and the setting is super clean and professional. I cant wait for the pandemic to be over so I sip my coffee in this beautiful urban environment.
OH! and their cups are re-usable glass, and come with a cute little coaster and lid, this way customers can be more conscious of the environment. Love this idea because I love re-using and recycling."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5LTVqRUpnEAE,"Sustainable practices, excellent space,  delicious roast"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5NjhMYkhBEAE,"Delicious coffee, roasted on site, 100% vegan, & quick service.

My go-to at any cafe is an iced black Americano with extra espresso. At lot of coffee chains have bitter espresso which makes my Americano unpleasant, but Ameteur Coffee was on point. I added a splash of oat milk because it's my favorite plant milk & most places don't have it.
I had a great jar of coffee, it was already less expensive than many other places, & the sustainability of returnable jars made this tree hugger's day. I think I found my new coffee spot."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5a3F2MmJ3EAE,"Fun and nice place. Good parking, friendly and knowledgeable staff. The Sweet Magnolias GF pastries might have been a little stale on a Sunday morning (but I've not had them before so that might be the normal state.) They were delicious.

I got Artemis Byzantium tea as a latte, wife got the Lady London Fog. A bit surprised by the glass jar serving mugs and koozies, but they worked very well and we get a buck of next time.

The team might have taken a bit longer to make but were worth the wait. Will definitely be back!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5bEk2TEl3EAE,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTdzdYUGNnEAE,Wow!!!... best latte I have ever had. The berry scone was delicious as well.

Their treats are wonderful, sourced from Sweet Magnolia Bakery and all vegan with a good portion both gluten free and vegan. I love their emphasis on reusable and environmentally friendly serving options. I will definitely be returning:) Make sure you check out their parking map on their website, it’s a bit confusing if you don’t know where to go."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDcGZETGZBEAE,Placed an order for 8am pick up. Arrived and had to wait to be acknowledged. Once acknowledged was told they didn't have it ready and that someone didn't come in for their shift so we would have to wait. We had a stop to make around the corner so we said okay and we would do that while we waited. We arrived back and let them know we were back and then proceeded to wait over half an hour for our food. Even after clarifying that we ordered 3 waffles we were only given two and had to wait longer. Then the staff proceeded to be rude about everything. Great food but terrible service.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDd1ozQXBnRRAB,"This is a serious coffee house.  They roast their beans on site and have a variety of coffees to choose from.  I highly recommend the pistachio latte!!! Their gluten free waffles were really good as well.  Very thankful the weather was nice and we could sit outside with a lovely little view of St. Cicilia Cathedral.  Situated next to Omaha staple, Lisa’s Radial Cafe as a reference point... it’s a nice local alternative coffee choice!  Five stars."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDdnQ3V2p3RRAB,This might be one of my favorite coffee shops ever! They have incredible beans and know a ton about them. They're super kind and helpful. The coffee and baked goods (especially the brownie) are all great.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDMEwzek5BEAE,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDdi15NEN3EAE,This is a little secret gem! A must visit! Everything is delicious! My favorite is their Chia pudding!

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDeC1LM3dRRRAB,A true hidden gem in Omaha worth the trip you will find some very cool things here

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzNGVTUFJBEAE,Really cute little place that has both a wide selection of coffee and teas. There snack / breakfast items were delicious. Has a great casual environment. My only 2 complaints was there not a single outlet plug in anything. I know it's a lot of students going there to study and should be something consider getting in the future. The seating situation is also the not the most comfortable. A cute place to go get something to drink but I would not recommend studying there.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzN3RxYzV3RRAB,First time and coffee was good. Small but nice with good people.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzOWNTMFF3EAE,"This was our first visit, and it was great.  They serve pastries from Sweet Magnolias (who are just around the corner), and we were already big fans of theirs.  The shop is smaller than many others, but feels more comfortable rhan clausterphobic.  The staff were quite friendly and welcoming...and did I mention the coffee was excellent?  The shop doesn't use paper cups for to-go orders, but have glass jars which may be returned for a refund on a future order (if I'm not mistaken).  Amateur Coffee has acquired a new enthusiastic fan."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNODZlY21nRRAB,"LOVE this place. I can’t drink a lot of caffeine, so their alternative drinks are really freaking good. I got the Turmeric Oat Milk latte. Only complaint is they don’t have the most comfortable seating. But it’s a really small spot, so they did their best!"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNa3RMN0VREAE,"I had a seasonal peppermint mocha latte and a piece of cinnamon coffee cake. Both were amazing! I was very impressed that everything is vegan and they take additional measures to be environmentally friendly as well. Since everything is vegan my sister, who cannot eat dairy, was very excited to have a place she can go and order anything off of the menu. This is a small shop with a varying pastry menu. There were 5 options the day we went and everything looked great!"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNNC11LWxRRRAB,"Vegan coffee shop. Also using glass jars for sustainability, with a discount if you bring the jar back to use on consecutive visits. My husband and I got the maple latte. Made with maple syrup and oatmilk creamer. We are not vegan. But these lattes were amazing. We went back the next day to grab two more as we headed out of town."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNdzhYVWpBRRAB,"So many great coffee shops in Omaha, and this is another one of them. I had a orangecinni latte on the seasonal menu and it was so delicious I ordered a second to-go. My to-go latte came in a glass jar with a sweet unique lid that I will definitely be able to reuse.  After reading more about to shop later, I learned that they use oat milk as a dairy substitute in all of their drinks. So many surprises! I will be visiting more often."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNa1pPYW1BRRAB,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNZ2NHZ0h3EAE,"This is a rare find as it is a vegan coffee shop which serves oat milk.
They have exceptionally friendly staff that will go out of their way to explain things.

The only issue I found was, their seats are all very high stools. It doesn't seem very wheelchair friendly. You have to be the type of person that can sit on a stool without a back. I just know of some people who might have issues.
It makes for slightly uncomfortable seating, but it's a small space so it does maximize space

Pricing is pricier but it's vegan milk which usually costs more. ($6 for a latte with syrup)  They have oat, almond and coconut as options.
Parking is available in front as street parking or in the back in a parking lot.
Great little gem!

The spirulina steamer for me was a 4 ... I think I just ordered the wrong one. For spirulina, it's good, but I'm apparently not the biggest fan of it.
I got a decaf vanilla on my second go. 5 
The baked goods are from magnolia bakery. I wasn't as much a fan of the scones, but the vanilla donut was 5 

They have a bottle program now to recover on waste. Pay an extra $1 and you can keep the cup. Return it and you can get $1 off your next drink."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNM283OTZ3RRAB,Golden milk... Yum yum yum
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNbm9tMGtRRRAB,"I very much love this Mid Town coffee shop.  Their vegan offerings are perfect for vegan and non-vegan folks.  The staff are very friendly and always want to make sure they are taking care of your needs.  I love their non-traditional drinks like the Beet Ginger Latte--my FAV!!!!  They always have gluten-free pastry options as well.  When Jacob is roasting coffee beans, it smells so wonderful!!!!  Thank you Jacob and Jasmyn!!!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNbnBiSnF3RRAB,"This place is AMAZING!! Listen, I love oat milk and this is absolutely the place to go. Their drinks are fantastic and the atmosphere is cozy.

(I didn't work at Amateur Coffee, but I was an amazing barista for Borders and MJ Java.) Sadly, I think the new employee was not being taught customer service well. Also I know I should not complain about price because I could read the menu, but I was disappointed by the size of the $5 beet juice latte. On the other hand, I was impressed that there was such a thing on the menu."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwNzRXcWZ3EAE,"Fantastic!  At Last!!  I can't thank them enough for being Open in Omaha!! Omaha, Amateur Coffee is worth supporting.  Each detail of the experience has been joyfully implemented.  From shape and thickness of each type of glass or dish to the stripey paper straws. And the vegan treats are a taste phenomenon.  They are all vegan. And several also GF/nut free. And coffee, I didn't think it was possible but Amateur Coffee has me ""loving something more"" about you, too. .."

The baked goods are always delicous. It's nice to have a good vegan place to go in the midwest. If you have the opportunity definitely stop in, my personal favorite is the maple iced latte. Don't forget to tip your baristas!"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVMzlqRzhnRRAB,"Cute little spot. I tried the gluten free waffle; it was excellent. I also had a matcha and rose latte; equally as excellent. And I tried the gluten free frosted brownie; it wasn't for me. But awesome, friendly, fast service."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURrbGRpc2tnRRAB,"I don't hand out 5 stars easily.  Something has to WOW me / surprise me on the positive side / exceed my expectations.  During a weekend trip to Omaha,  I visited a lot of places that are on the ""must visit"" lists.  The iced pistachio latte from Amateur Coffee was the best thing I consumed during my time in Omaha.  The flavor builds and develops as each sip moves from the front of your pallet to the back.  I highly recommend it."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURrNmRmQmZREAE,Yummy!  Have milk alternatives.  Even called to check with Baker on brownie ingredients for me.   Thanks!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURrMFlyT3d3RRAB,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURrNXBLSFdREAE,"Pro: coffee is fantastic.  I think everything is vegan (?) and I did not miss the cow's milk in my latte at all.

Con: gluten-free and vegan waffle is sticky and tastes like vegetables.  If your intestines and ethics require you to consume vegan and gluten-free things, then I am really glad for you that this place exists, because it's probably the best waffle you're going to be able to get.  But general omnivores might want to go elsewhere.

Just a thing I wish I would've known: don't bring your baby.  There's nowhere for someone without the core strength of an adult to sit, and you'll have to change them on the bathroom floor, which is kind of gross."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZdXRMUGl3RRAB,Went here for the first time the other weekend. My daughter is gluten intolerant so this place was perfect! She loved all the options. The coffee was wonderful. Great flavor and some fun combinations. Baked goods from Sweet Magnolia so you can't go wrong. Atmosphere was quaint and casual. Location is right on cumming so I think that limits the walk-ins. So you have to want to go here. Patio in the back is small but it is a nice place for two to sit and get away from the street noise.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZdXZDV1RBEAE,Best vegan friendly coffee in town! Great coffee and good vegan deserts to go with it. Friendly employees as well!

Edit: Went back. Got an iced vanilla latte, and  it was the best I've ever had."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZOU42YV93RRAB,"Should offer stuff other than Vegan. Might help business. You are cutting out 3/4 of your customers.  Both styles should be available not just,  what you see is what you get. Poor business model in my opinion. I visit Omaha often, once a month for a week or 2, on business. Trying to find an alternative to Starbucks."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBM3Z5UV93RRAB,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnMHN5LTl3RRAB,Try the oat milk latte. You’ll thank me for it. My other favorite part is the beautiful artwork on their coffee packaging - so much attention to every detail. Lovely.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnN0tHVWpBRRAB,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3MDVtSzFBRRAB,"OMG! Just went there for the first time, ordered an Oat-milk Maple Latte... I just can't describe how good it is... I hadn't had such a good cup of coffee for a while now. DEFINITELY coming back! Love the vegan vibe too ;)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBX3V1M0pBEAE,My favorite coffee shop in Omaha
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBeklidWxRRRAB,"A great little place! The service was very friendly, there is parking in the back, and the latte was fantastic! It took a second to get used to it being vegan, because the flavor is distinctly different, but overall that ended up being a good thing! I can get a decent latte at many places, but this is somewhere to go for something unique."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRcWZXNk5REAE,This is one of the best coffee shops in Omaha and a great new addition to everything happening in Midtown! The people that work here are also super kind and the love for what they do shines through all that they do here!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnaHJpTTR3RRAB,"Best coffee in town! The owner's and staff are so nice. Everything is vegan, from the coffee drinks to the pastries to their amazing chocolate chip waffles. The space is small and intimate, with a patio out back. You can buy bags of their various roasts, and they even offer a monthly subscription service!"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnc0o3Mm9BRRAB,"Decaf Americano has no body or flavor, mouth feel chalky."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRbmNHTlFBEAE,"They use oat milk, which I had not tried before - it's delicious! I also loved the chia pudding.
Recommended for any coffee lover, vegan or not!
They have non-coffee drinks as well, like golden milk (turmeric honey) and others."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBZ1lHU0ZBEAE,"Staff were ready and willing to explain the ingredients and process of several drinks. My drink was delicious though dainty. There's not a whole lot of seating, but there are a few more tables out back in the nicely shaded alley."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3N1lYRjVBRRAB,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3M3VTNURBEAE,Glad I ran across this little gem while visiting Omaha.  My oat milk latte was smooth and delicious.  Will be back in the morning for another latte and also to try some of the food offerings.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBZy1iZlZ3EAE,Perfect!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRcE9peHRRRRAB,"They never fail to disappoint! My favorite coffee shop in town. (Ok maybe ever) It is vegan but that's not it's best feature. The staff are just as amazing as everything on their menu. Everyone I know that's been loves it. Lots of variety, if you are indecisive they are happy to help! Make sure to try this place. :-)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRXy1HWV9nRRAB,"Great coffee, great food, great people. Chill, hipster vibe. If you have food allergies, everything is disclosed on the menu. The music was on point."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3ZzltOEhnEAE,"You can tell the owners at Amateur Coffee love what they do. It’s unique that all the seating is at two countertops with bar stools (or the patio outside) so you sit quite close to the baristas. Because you sit in such close proximity to the baristas, interaction with them is easy and its obvious to see that the owners love what they do. The shop is quite and clean. Atmosphere is quiet. I met clients there and it was easy to have our conversation and enjoy great coffee."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRejZmMmNnEAE,Such a cool space. The staff is very friendly and the coffee is amazing!!!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBNExhLWp3RRAB,"Always a pleasant experience. They are very knowledgeable about coffee and tea. Out of all the roasters in town, Amateur is by far the best."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBd01ubWNnEAE,Just amazing coffee and staff. Would gladly go back
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnNXB6RElnEAE,"I went to visit Amateur Coffee after searching for Vegan food in Omaha and it was one of two options that popped up. I'm so glad I took the time to go here. The staff was incredible and the coffee was top notch, I will definitely go here again when visiting Omaha. When I told them I was searching for places to get good vegan food they actually wrote out a list for me of where to go and what to get. Thank you all so much!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnNXVxeTlBRRAB,Always try to support Vegan establishments whenever I’m in a city. This place didn’t disappoint. The jade matcha and rose latte was delicious and I got a lemon blueberry blackberry scone that hit the spot.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRbzlEWS1RRRAB,The oatmeal-based milk creates a really yummy latte. The owners are super friendly. We’re excited to have them in the neighborhood!

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnNzkzRmxnRRAB,"Love every single detail of this all-vegan cafe. Their brand of oat milk, Oatly is the best animal milk substitute I’ve ever tasted. Jasmyn and Jacob pour their knowledge and TLC into each hand-crafted offering on their menu.
Pro-tip: Sign up for their rewards program.
 “Love Something More” ❤️"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRdmZHSDJBRRAB,"Great little coffee shop. The owners staff the shop and are super friendly and helpful. Great customer service, great coffee. Tiny little shop so you may want to get an order to go. The pastries are lovely and the waffles are super yummy.  Everything is vegan which is great for us plant based folks and those non vegans will still enjoy it. It is so nice have a vegan coffee shop in Omaha!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnd3BMd0pnEAE,I’ve been in many times before for the excellent coffee and lattes. Today I had the waffle and turmeric latte. Both were amazing. Such a good vibe

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBejRMSE9BEAE,Great service! We had a last minute coffee emergency and they saved the day!! Thank thank
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnM1BiVWF3EAE,Wonderful vibe! Great coffee. Obvious that they know how to roast coffee in a way to coax out the best flavors of the bean. Great space to relax and visit with a friend.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3cUltcTJBRRAB,"Everything was fantastic, the owners are really nice and informative about there products and are willing to explain any questions you have, there vegan pastries and coffee are the best I've ever had!!!"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnc2NyOW13RRAB,I am estatic to have a Vegan Cafe in Omaha. Not only that everything I tried was outstanding. I've never had a better cappuccino. The owners are absolutely delightful. The do have a high chair option which greatly impressed me. The owners said they loved kids which was really comforting because my son definitely left crumbs from his pastries. Looking forward to many stops and trying many beverages.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRNXVmSG1BRRAB,Great spot!  Not a ton of room but great drinks including a good selection of teas and non-coffee items.  Try the tumeric latte!

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3d0x2c053EAE,"The staff is terrifically friendly. They engage early and often with customers ensuring their needs and met. The food and coffee is vegan oriented, which isn't for me, but the tea and atmosphere are wonderful. It's small and cozy which is just what I'm looking for in a local place."
